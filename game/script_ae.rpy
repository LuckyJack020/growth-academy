    AE "The answer is: slowly. A bit here and there, making her dumber, sluttier, hornier... and she tries to fight it. She's in denial about how good it feels, puffing up her persona like a bubble."
    "She tries to fix it, but it gets worse and worse and her sensations get better and better."

    MCT "Walking with her feels... odd. Not only do I not know what to say but it's like there's nothing I can reasonably talk about with her. It's like I've gotten so used to her as a \"force\" that it's slipped my mind that she's a girl."
    MCT "I didn't really plan this far ahead. C'mon... I gotta think of something to talk about."
    MC "If there were one thing you could fix about the school, what would it be?"
    "Though the question came a bit out of nowhere, I figured it'd be at least a bit interesting to listen to her candid thoughts on Seichou itself, aside from the administrative stuff."

    AE "Hmm..."
    MC "Stump ya?"
    AE "More by virtue that there's plenty to be changed."
    MCT "Quite the ball of sunshine there."
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "Many of the school's resources aren't allocated for professional mental and spiritual health, I find. What we have is a step in the right direction, but the infrastructure is more of a state issue rather than a school administrative one."
    MC "Huh... that's a broad answer, but I get what you mean. Figured you'd go for something more specific."
    show AE neutral-annoyed
    AE "Perhaps I should throw the question back to you, then."
    MC "Oh. Hmm..."
    MC "The corbels on the clocktower."
    show AE surprised
    AE "..."
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "Hotsure-san... for once you actually managed to completely stump me."
    MC "On what?"
    AE "What on earth is a corbel?"
    MC "Ah, it's a piece of architectural design which supports a structure's top."
    MC "See, the thing with stone is that while it's really good for compression, it can't withstand too much tension. Hence, the corbels keep the structure from collapsing from the top down."
    MC "I noticed that some of the corbels are in a kinda neoclassical style, which is cool, but the modillons, the smaller bits between, look like they're not the same design. It's kinda off putting when you notice it."
    "Shiori and I had come to a stop at this point, and now she looked at me as though I was completely insane."
    "However..."
    show AE happy
    AE "...Pff... Pff-Ehehe"
    AE "Heh-Khm-Ah, well, that's quite enough of that."
    MC "Ahh, got ya to laugh."
    show AE smile
    AE "...I suppose you did."
    MC "Figured I just broke a law of the universe, eh?"
    show AE neutral
    AE "Ehh. If you want to see it that way, by all means."
    MC "I guess I should know better than to break laws around you, huh?"
    AE "Well..."
    "She inhaled through her nose, taking a second before responding in full, as though assessing her opinion beforehand."
    AE "The law isn't the end all be all."
    MC "Huh?"
    MCT "Wait, what?"
    MC "I... never expected to hear that from you."
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "Well, it's the truth."
    show AE neutral
    AE "Rules and regulations are important, to me they are some of the most precious things we have as a species, but they are so because they are meant to be reflections of natural law."
    "Taking a few steps forward, she ushered me on as I followed."
    AE "What I care about is the {i}moral{/i} law. And to understand the {i}moral{/i} law, you must first be able to properly perceive the moral \"aught\". As I've heard it said, man doesn't differ greatly on things which are evil, but they very much so do on which evils are permissible."
    AE "However, reality is not simple. Morality very much so is, but the issue is that things can be so complex that it is difficult to perceive what one \"ought\" to do. Indeed we can intuit morality, but just as well I believe one can use proper reason to understand the deeper facets of any situation."
    "As Shiori and I continued to walk, I became more engrossed in her topic. Admittedly, these were things I didn't think of all that often."
    AE "Live life looking for the reality of the moral law, and know how to apply it in the most compassionate way possible when dealing with areas of grey. Mercy is a form of justice."
    MC "And what about areas of stark black?"
    show AE glasses
    AE "... Strike with a vengeance."
    show AE neutral
    AE "I do believe in a stark white and black. Very much so. But it doesn't always do to think of moral law in the same way. Instead, it's better to think in terms of \"good, better, and best\" or \"bad, worse, and worst\" if you want something with a bit more accuracy."
    AE "People {i}aught{/i} to have the freedom to live their lives in a manner which does not harm their fellow man, but that does not mean that the actions they take under that natural right of freedom are right. It's hierarchical structuring of the rights of man informed by the dignity of man."
    MC "Hm."
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "Anything I need to elaborate on?"
    MC "I guess I'm just lost, is all."
    show AE neutral
    AE "It's certainly a long, complicated topic. Man has been struggling with it for many millennia, and I reckon we will for many more."
    MC "Many more?"
    AE "Just so."
    MC "..."
    "As we talked, I began to focus more on this loneliness and isolation I've been feeling. It stirred up dark thoughts almost immediately."
    MC "All these years and we still haven't progressed to being better people, then, eh?"
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "Progress?"
    MC "Like, considering where we are compared to people in the past."
    show AE angry
    AE "I see... I must say, I find that belief of a \"progress\" forward from supposedly inferior ancestors to be a bit fanciful. Quality of life? Perhaps. But right and wrong aren't modern inventions of \"rational minds\". We must admit that there is morality, or that there is none."
    MC "It all just feels pointless."
    show AE neutral-smug
    AE "Calm down there, Qoheleth."
    MC "Kou- eh?"
    show AE neutral
    AE "Ah, sorry, bit obscure."
    AE "From the sounds of it, you're looking at it from the perspective of a \"point or purpose\". Tell me, what or whom is the giver of this purpose? It can't be created from the self, nor from \"nature\" if you look at it from the view of man being his material components."
    MC "Huh? I don't..."
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "Hm. Maybe this line of thinking isn't appropriate..."
    show AE neutral
    AE "Have you heard of the notion of \"telos\"?"
    MC "Not really."
    AE "It's this notion of a \"higher good\" or a finality of man's purpose of being. We can observe that the modus of obtaining this isn't through gratification of the self, and as such, we must either reject the notion of telos or reject that we must live justly."
    AE "I find the physicality of a natural telos to be insufficient. Similarly, spiritual telos is certainly good, though I understand that this is a form of thinking which is not sufficient for some."
    AE "Therefore, let me ask you this: What is your \"telos\"? What is your purpose, your function in life?"
    MC "..."
    "They were a lot of big words. Hard ones. But still, I couldn't help but see where she was going."
    MC "I don't know, but the fact that I accept there is good and bad means there is one to find, right?"
    AE "Precisely so. If there is a good by which you should live to give your life purpose, you must acknowledge that there is a point. The only way to avoid this is to say there is no good."
    MC "...All things fade with time-"
    show AE angry
    AE "That's not an excuse. Nothing fades into eternity. It can't. The fact that it's been done in the first place is a stamp in time, a mark that will never fade."
    MC "Well, that's good and rational in itself, but I don't know if reality matches it."
    show AE neutral
    AE "We've talked on telos, on right and wrong, and we may talk on love, which I am sure you feel for those you do. What is empirical or \"real\" about these things if not as a vestige of experience and reason?"
    show AE angry
    AE "Therefore; enough of this talk of what's \"rational\" and what is not. \"Rational\" is a dime a dozen catch-all word which can be applied to any view which has a line of logic behind it. I care about your state of having reason and applying it justly."
    MCT "She's so...confusing."
    "I pondered longer on Shiori's strange, seemingly contradictory nature. At this point, I wasn't even sure she believed most of the things she said half of the time, but..."
    "I was glad. Hearing her cheer me on and give me motivation was soothing."
    MC "So... what's your purpose?"
    show AE neutral
    AE "Hm?"
    MC "What is your telos, I guess?"
    show AE neutral-eyebrow
    AE "My purpose?"
    "She stopped for a moment before humming to herself quietly."
    show AE neutral
    AE "My life isn't my property; not something to be thrown away. Just as well, it's not mine to selfishly cling to when there are those who need it."
    show AE happy
    AE "My life, and who I am, is for the well being of my fellow man. For their well being and uplifting. It's for the natural law which I hold dear. I value service. Simple as that."
    MC "That doesn't mean you can't try to live for yourself every once in a while, though, right?"
    show AE neutral
    AE "Hmm..."
    "She looked me up and down for a moment, before looking back at her greatly distended behind."
    show AE aroused-3
    AE "I suppose."
    show AE neutral
    AE "Enough high concepts for now, though. It may be wise to begin heading back."
    MC "Huh? Already?"
    AE "We've been walking around the island for nearly two hours."
    MC "Eh?!"
    "I looked down at my phone, and as I had feared, Shiori was absolutely right."
    MC "GAH! Oh man, we're gonna break curfew..."
    AE "Relax. I walked us out this way because our trajectory walking back would lead us directly to the dorms. We'll be back before sundown."
    MC "Ah. Hooo, okay."
    MC "Still... view is pretty."
    "Shiori and I both looked out past the mountain side towards the bright, blue sea on the horizon, it's foamy white crest crashing against the shore as a cool breeze rolled in."
    show AE admire
    AE "Hm... I suppose it is."
    hide AE with dissolve
    "And with this, we walked back to Seichou just in time. I still wasn't sure if I completely agreed with Shiori, or if any of what she said was true... but it was a good time nonetheless."
