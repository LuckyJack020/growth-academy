    "It was a bit hard to follow but I guess some yakuza types were shaking down this old man's ramen shop, shady loan shark stuff."
    "While three guys were going to town on the old man, who I guess was the shop owner, the protagonist walks through the door, dropping the ingredients he was bringing in, and proceeds to go raging tiger on their asses."
    FMG "Dang, this movie doesn't mess around."
    MC "Entertaining for short attention spans I guess."

    FMG "Quite, it's getting good!"
    "The protagonist was tearing these guys apart piece by piece- head dodge to the left, round house kick to the guy's face. A blocked strike- immediately countered with a palm strike that shattered the thug's elbow."
    FMG "Sweet! That's what I'm talking about!"
    "Meanwhile the Big Boss and his even bigger guard were just standing there letting all this happen."
    "Big Boss" "Sumasshu— kill him."
    "Sumasshu was a massive dude, head, and shoulders above the protagonist. He had an ominous look to him, not the least of which was due to most of his face being hidden due to his long hairstyle."
    MC "Hmm, this guy reminds me of someone."
    Tomoko "I'll say. Why would anyone wear their hair like that?"
    FMG "It's a common feature used in visual media to obscure a character's personality so we don't feel empathy with them. Seems to work here, that guy looks like a faceless monster."
    MC "I'm feeling oddly attacked for some reason."
    "The protagonist's punches bounced off the big dude, who grabbed him by the back of his head and then slammed him through a wooden countertop, and then kicked him in the chest, sending him through a three story window."
    Tomoko "Man, he got jacked up."
    MC "Since when was the scene on the third floor?"
    FMG "That's a question that doesn't need an answer. Did you {i}see{/i} that? Bro got his shit caved in!"
    MC "It is a bit refreshing to see the protagonist isn't untouchable, I'll give it that."
    "The guy then falls out the window, cue the love interest screaming \"NOOO!\" as they grab her and take her away. She broke loose, only to have Sumasshu punch her so hard it knocked her out."
    MC "{i}Pow!{/i} Right in the baby maker! Guy is brutal"
    "They left with the girl and then burned the place down. The protagonist wakes up the next day because he conveniently managed to land on a bunch of mattresses that had been thrown out in the alley."
    "The guy is understandably pissed and proceeded to go through the whole city kicking everyone's ass."
    MC "Oh come on, he didn't even say a word and everyone in the bar is already trying to fight him as soon as he walks in."
    FMG "It's a Yakuza bar."
    Tomoko "How do you know that?"
    FMG "Shut up! That's how."
    MC "Damn, that was fast. He really laid waste to them."
    FMG "I know right? The fight choreography in this movie is actually really good. I have no idea why it got such low reviews."
    Tomoko "Maybe because there isn't much of a plot?"
    FMG "{i}Again{/i}, I have no idea why it got such low reviews. {w}It's a kung fu movie. The less talking and more punching there is the better."
    "After filling up emergency rooms all across the city, the movie reached the final showdown scene with the Big Dude."
    FMG "Oo this is gonna be good— the revenge fight!"
    MC "Let me guess, he uses his new found skills and overwhelming rage to magically beat the much stronger opponent?"
    Tomoko "When did this movie start having a narrator?"
    FMG "Exactly. Don't ruin the best part."
    "To be fair it was a pretty tense scene. The guy and the Big Dude facing off. The plucky young hero vs. the faceless monster."
    MCT "And now I made myself sad."
    "Sumashu, or whatever his name was, fired off a flying kick that would have torn the guy's head off if he didn't duck out of the way, and hit a telephone poll instead, knocking it over in the process."
    "Sparks flew everywhere and the whole street went dark."
    FMG "That was so badass!"
    MC "That is {i}so{/i} fake."

    MC "What I mean is, don't you think that's a tad bit too unrealistic, even for this movie?"

    MC "Yeah, but unrealistic is normal for you."
    FMG "And seeing the unrealistic should be normal for you by now. Glad we could agree how awesome this movie is."
    "Awesome was a bit of an exaggeration but admittedly the fighting in the movie was pretty cool."
    "In contrast to the previous beat downs to every throwaway extra by the main character, the protagonist was getting his ass served on a silver platter by Big Dude, who brushed off all his punishing strikes like he was a brick wall."
    "It honestly pulled you into the moment to root for the guy. All his cunning, strength, and technique were meaningless in the face of this unstoppable onslaught that was slowly toying with him, enjoying his torture."
    MC "Oh he'll pull through... I hope."
    FMG "Are you going to cry?"
    MC "{i}Pshh!{/i} No..."
    MCT "If this dude dies after all of this, I'm going to start bawling. They always kill off my favorite characters..."
    "In a mirror image of the opening scene, Big Dude sent the guy flying with a dragon kick through a storefront window. His lifeless bloody body laid limp over the broken store display."
    MC "What? That can't be how this ends!"
    "Akira & Tomoko" "{i}Shhhhhh!{/i}"
    MCT "What is this, a library?"
    "Sumashu knelt over his body to deliver the final blow— {w}Only for the guy to spring to life and stab him through the neck with a jagged glass shard."
    MC "YES!"
    FMG "Oh come on! Now I know why this movie only got two stars."
    MC "What? The good guy wins. Everyone is happy."
    FMG "That was {i}so{/i} cheap. What a letdown. He lost that fight, he didn't earn that victory at all."
    Tomoko "To be fair he might have been tired from fighting half the city for 72 hours straight."
    MC "Just goes to show you that a clever mind can triumph over brute strength."
    FMG "That's not an encouraging life lesson then, considering you have neither."
    MC "Just for that, no more back scratches."
    Tomoko "I'll scratch your back Akira."
    FMG "Thank you, Tomo."
    MCT "I've overplayed my hand."
    FMG "Oh wait, you're still here."
    MC "You can't get rid of me that easily. Besides, there's something I wanted to check."
    "The rest of the movie was pretty predictable. The protagonist reaches the chamber of the Yakuza boss, who at this point is pissing his pants in fear at the mere sight of the guy that took down Sumashu."
    "He threw the guy out the window into a garbage truck, unties his girlfriend, they get all kissy-kissy, yada-yada. I was fast forwarding through by this point."
    FMG "What are you doing?"
    MC "Hmm, call it a hunch. I just wanted to check something."

    FMG "THAT'S SO COOL!"
    Tomoko "Are you sure it's him?"
    MC "Dude look."
    "I skipped back to the first scene that had brighter lighting."
    MC "Look at the way he hunches over and the way he just casually walks."
    FMG "You're totally right, that's gotta be him!"
    FMG "I wonder why he never said anything before?"
    MC "No kidding. Man, if I was in a movie I'd be telling everyone I knew, even strangers on the street."
    Tomoko "He didn't even have any speaking lines."
    FMG "Still counts. He's a surprisingly good actor. I wouldn't have thought such a lamewad like Hageshi-sensei could play such a terrifying, soulless badass."
    MC "What are you talking about? Have you ever made eye contact with the dude? There's plenty of terror to be found in his soulless stare. If anything, covering up his face made him less scary than in real life."
    FMG "Oh man, we gotta ask him about the movie next time we see him. If I had his number I'd totally call him right now."
    MC "I'm pretty sure that's exactly why he never gave you his number. Besides, if you ask him about it, he'll probably just say two words and then ask if you need anything else."
    FMG "Hell no! I want details. We're gonna make Hageshi-sensei spill the beans."
    MC "Sounds like a plan then. Maybe we'll get him to divulge more about his shady past."
    FMG "What are you even talking about?"
    MC "Nevermind, one thing at a time. Where's my bag of gummy worms?"

    Mom "It started off as a hobby that I would do from time to time, I only began to get really invested in it while I was pregnant with Keisuke and Tomoko since there wasn't much I could do. At first, it was random short stories of whatever came into my mind."
    Mom "But one day I noticed a couple of birds outside my bedroom window interacting with each other, they would perch themselves on a branch every day, and every day they would nuzzle up next to other rubbing their heads."
    Mom "I must've watched them for a week straight before the gears in my head started turning. My first real book began forming right before my very eyes."
    Mom "A girl starved for love coming from an abusive household, meeting the boy of her dreams and freeing herself from years of torment and torture."

    Dad "It varies, heh. Some days I love it and others I wish I could be out sick. With how long I've been working there I find most of my enjoyment comes from helping customers, however at the same time that can also be the worst part of the job."
    Dad "While I've had my fair share of rude customers, I feel extra bad for the other employees on the floor. Some people simply have no respect for people who work these types of jobs and it's heartbreaking, to say the least."
    Dad "I had this one customer come in looking for some light bulbs as his had died. One of my best employees, Benjiro, tried to locate the product and couldn't find it, we had ran out the day prior and didn't expect a shipment till next week." 
    Dad "After he told the older gentlemen this, Aoki was bombarded with insults. Obviously, I stepped in when I heard what was happening... it's just stuff like that hurts to see."
    Dad "We're all human beings and to see someone get ridiculed like that over something so small... It's gross. So I do my best to treat my fellow employees as best I can and to let them know how much I appreciate their work."
