    "I just nodded and looked away, wondering what I would have to do to live a normal life."
    Nurse "Anyways, your growth factor. According to these results, you have hyper-productive hair follicles."
    Nurse "Not hypertrichosis, so you don't need to worry about having to shave your nose and forehead and so on, but you'll definitely need a barber more often than most."
    MC "My hair? It's always grown like a weed, that's nothing new."
    Nurse "Heh heh... Well, the degree is never certain, but remember that it's not fully manifested yet. Whatever rate of growth you're used to, it will increase by some amount, guaranteed."
    MC "And... and my sister? Does she have the same thing? Does she have anything at all?"
    Nurse "I'm sorry, but since she's not a minor anymore I'm not allowed to share her medical information with anyone she hasn't specified..."
    "I mulled over this for a few seconds while she wrote on her clipboard."
    MC "So, that's it? Is it going to be all of my hair, er, everywhere?"
    Nurse "Body and head hair grow at different cycles and intensities, so it's hard to say. But we'll be sure to check up on all of your growth throughout the year, so please try and keep a record of each time you cut any of your hair."
    MC "...Do I have to?"
    Nurse "No, but we're only here to help. If you're comfortable only knowing what you know now about your condition, we won't force you. But you still have to come in for measurements and such."
