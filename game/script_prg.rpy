    "I grabbed her notebook and a pencil, and rifled through the pages, searching for a clean sheet. The notebook had seen its fair share of use, and was in danger of losing some of its pages. Something with bold, dark colors caught my eye and I stopped mid page turn."
    "On the page was a drawing of two people, a man and a woman by the looks of it, and they were... kissing? Their arms were wrapped around each other in a romance novel style hug, and the man had the woman leaned back slightly into his arms."
    "Scanning over the drawing, my eyes landed on a surprisingly detailed crest emblazoned on the woman's shirt. Something about it struck me as familiar. Quickly dismissing the thought, I turned my focus back to the rest of the drawing."
    "The woman was shorter than the man, at least by a handful of inches, and she had absolutely enormous breasts. Looking over the rest of her showed that she was a shapely woman everywhere else as well, with thick thighs and a generously proportioned rear end. "
    "Turning my focus to the man, he looked oddly simple, with formal pants and a white button down dress shirt. What struck me as odd was his long, flowing hair, which stopped mid-back, and he had the same crest featured on his shirt as the woman did... wait."
    "I looked down at my shirt and stared. There was the crest: the Seichou Academy crest. "
    "Reaching behind me, I felt for my hair. While not quite to my mid back, it was surely on its way. Even my dress pants matched the image almost to a tee. "
    "Looking over to the girl again revealed little more than what I had previously noticed, until I glanced at her hair and noticed a rather miniscule detail. Tiny purple beads were in her hair, forming the ends into two distinct ponytails, which hung over the shoulder. "
    "My heart began to race as the pieces suddenly fit together. This was supposed to be Aida and I kissing. "

    PRG "What would you think if I made fried rice today?"
    MC "I'd commend you for the delicious, yet simple rice, but also suggest that you try making something more complex."
    PRG "I-I'm glad you think so highly of my skills in the kitchen! A-And who said that the rice would be simple?"
    "I let loose a wry chuckle. I was on my way to the cooking classroom with Aida. She hadn't been in the kitchen since she'd gotten pregnant, and she had decided to make today her official return to the kitchen. I, being the kind and caring friend that I was, agreed to tag along and taste whatever she fancied cooking."
    "Tucked under Aida's arm was her trusty recipe book, which had seen better days. Its pages were torn in every which way, yet somehow, she had no trouble deciphering its contents."
    MC "So, how many recipes do you have in that notebook anyway?"
    PRG "Probably around 40, give or take a few. The majority of them haven't been put into use yet, so I just save them for whenever inspiration strikes."
    MC "Is it just recipes? It looks like there's way more than 40 pages used up."
    PRG "N-Not necessarily. I also keep a list of every spice or herb I use, along with what type of flavor it has, and what it works best with."
    "She flipped open her book and leafed through the pages until she came across one particularly worn page near the end."
    PRG "See? T-This helps me keep everything straight in the kitchen. Without this book, I don't know what I'd do."
    "Across the sheet was easily 50 individual herbs and spices, each one with a brief description, and a small list of meats, vegetables, and other spices that paired well with it. All of the ingredients were separated by type, as in, spicy goes with spicy, woodsy or mint type flavors went together, and so on."
    MC "Wow. I'm sure anyone could cook something incredible if they had access to this book."
    PRG "They could. That's why I never go anywhere without it. If I lost this, I'd have my work cut out for me."

    PRG "Keisuke, it's a notebook of my ideas, not some sort of government file."

    PRG "Y-Yeah, I came here yesterday after class and took these out to thaw. I wanted to make you something special, but I obviously had to thaw these beforehand. I was just hoping that you would be okay with my suggestion, otherwise, these would've gone to waste."

    "Aida took two cloves of garlic and began to chop them up into fine pieces. She instructed me to pat the lamb until it was dry and dust it with salt and pepper, which I did."
    "From the cupboard below the countertop, Aida pulled out a heavy cast iron skillet and set it on the stove adding just a bit of olive oil before turning it to medium-high heat. Once the pan had reached a warm enough temperature, Aida took the lamb chops and seared them for about five minutes before pulling them from the pan and placing them on two plates."

I busied myself with setting silverware on the countertop, until the lamb was finally ready. Aida took the two plates and set one in front of me, and then one for herself. She grabbed my extravagant bowl of salad, and set that next to our plates, completing our meal."

    MC "Now, I know the Dragons became an official team in 1946, but the city they originally started in was Himeji, right?"
    PRG "Close. You got the year right, but they actually got their start in Aioi, about 15 miles west of Himeji. They did end up moving their home stadium to Himeji in 1974, though."
    MC "And why was that? Why would they move if they had already established themselves?"
    PRG "Mainly for general game attendance. Aioi only has a population of just over 30,000 people, whereas Himeji has a population of over 500,000. Moving to a bigger city meant that more people would show up to their games, instead of just watching it on TV."

The minute I pulled my hair up, Aida spun back around and put her nose back into the book she was reading."

    BBW "And for good reason. It's a delicacy, the ultimate in Japanese dining. What's more, it originated from tea ceremonies, where it's serving required an inhuman-like attention to detail and precision."
