    MC "Because I don't want those feelings to hang over our relationship. I want our time together to be about us. Not about this looming worry."
    MC "I want Aida to feel happy and relaxed around me. Not scared."
    Takamura "I see."
    Takamura "Well, I would advise you against that."
    MC "Why do you say that, Sensei? You mean that we should let ourselves be worried about this stuff constantly?"
    Takamura "Oh, not at all, Hotsure-san. Not at all."
    Takamura "What I'm referring to is that trying to deliberately shut out your feelings isn't doing any good for either of you."
    Takamura "Your thoughts and feelings exist, and you should do your best to acknowledge them in a healthy manner. Shutting them out entirely isn't healthy, but wallowing in them like a pool isn't good for you either."
    Takamura "It's a matter of balance. Should you try to have carefree, fun, and enjoyable times with your girlfriend? Of course you should! That's a large part of what brings two people together. Mutual enjoyment."
    Takamura "However, part of a relationship is being able to rely on the other person to catch you when you're not at your best. It's a mutual give and take, if you will."
    Takamura "Now. I understand that you two have been under quite the stress load as of late. Likely a lot of questions, and a lot of things being thrown at you that you never expected."
    Takamura "Have you and Kodama-san taken time to just exist together?"
    MC "We have. Recently, she met my sister and we all had lunch together, and we played some video games, just Aida and I, and watched a movie together."
    Takamura "Good. Very good."
    Takamura "What other feelings have you had?"
    MC "Well... I guess I would say... thinking of how to be there for her?"
    MC "I understand the idea of standing by her side for all of this, but it's the more specific pregnancy stuff, I guess."

    MC "Right. But anyway, Aida still seems a little... awkward around me sometimes? I guess? And like, I don't want her to feel that way, because I care about her."
    MC "I want her to feel free to express herself and come to me for anything."
    Takamura "Hotsure-san, I'm going to stop you there."

    Takamura "Your hands are shaking."
    "I glanced down at my hands that had been moving as I spoke, and heeded her advice."
    Takamura "Now. I know Kodama-san fairly well through the cooking club. And, I can gather quite a bit about her from that exposure, plus what I've heard from you."
    Takamura "I would like you to take a minute, Hotsure-san. And think about her."
    Takamura "She's a quiet girl who came here alone. She knew no one, and she had no idea what was about to come her way, the entire idea of a \"growth factor\" being a new, and likely an almost unbelievable phenomenon to her."
    Takamura "She learns her factor and learns that it's the rarest and one of the most life altering of all."
    Takamura "She meets someone, a man, who she likes and sees as someone who she can grow closer to, so she does."
    Takamura "Then, her factor kicks in, and due to it, it forces her into a moment of passion that she couldn't control."
    Takamura "Of course... well, you know the rest."
    Takamura "And, as much as I hate to say it, people tend to talk. Rumors spread. And, just like that, most of the academy knows about the one woman on campus dealing with a pregnancy growth factor."

    Takamura "Now, I'd be willing to bet that Kodama-san feels incredibly indebted to you after all of this. And, she likely is just having a hard time showing it, so she comes off as awkward because she doesn't quite know how to put it into words."
    Takamura "I'd also bet that she's worried about rushing things, given how her factor essentially rushed things along for her."
    Takamura "And finally, I'd venture a guess that she feels like, after what happened, you sticking by her side through all of this might be too good to be true. So, she's still rather guarded as a result."

    Takamura "That said, might I give you a bit more... casual advice? Think of it coming not from a teacher, but from someone who wishes to see you both content and comfortable."
    MC "Please do, Sensei."
    "She took another sip of tea and glanced to me."

    Takamura "Now, I should say as well, everything that I'm telling you is simply my point of view. I would never try to tell you or Kodama-san how to conduct your relationship, nor how to handle the situation with your parents."
    Takamura "You both are adults, and those choices are yours alone to make."
    Takamura "I... I suppose you could say that I've... thought a great deal about how Kodama-san must be feeling, and I simply would like to help her in any way that I can."
    Takamura "And, I also must say, I carry a great deal of respect for you, Hotsure-san."
    Takamura "You've stood by her through quite a few harsh moments. That speaks volumes on your character."

    MC "First, you have to lower its hit points with an attack. Then, it's mana. After that, you can click the herd option and hope it's successful."

    Nurse2 "And, coming to a final conclusion about your size without extensive research is next to impossible, especially considering how diversified your factor is."
    show PRG worried
    PRG "Diversified?"
    Nurse2 "For instance, consider someone with a breast factor. Their factor will cause growth in their breasts, obviously. And, if someone has a hair growth factor, then the factor will, logically, only make their hair grow."
    Nurse2 "What I'm trying to say is that, usually, the factor only affects one part of the body, and it keeps itself there."
    Nurse2 "Your factor, however, is different. Yours seems to incorporate every part of a woman's body that would grow during the time of gestation."
    Nurse2 "And, your growth from this factor, while similar to other factors, isn't always the same on the inside."
    Nurse2 "Let's take a weight gain factor, for example. This factor, true to its nature, causes many parts of the body to swell. In essence, every part of the body will be affected. All of the ones that contain fat, anyway."
    Nurse2 "And generally, a lot of weight gain factors will put quite an emphasis on the abdomen of that person, causing it to grow and distend quite a bit."
    Nurse2 "However, as I'm sure you already know, a belly on someone with a weight gain factor, and a belly on someone with your factor, are very different."
    MC "Because the girl with the weight gain factor is holding fat, and the girl with Aida's factor is holding babies?"
    Nurse2 "Exactly, Hotsure-san. It's really not too complicated. The difference is easily seen from the shape differences. A weight gain factor would cause a more saggy, and I don't like this term, but a flabbier belly."
    Nurse2 "Whereas with you, Kodama-san. Your abdomen isn't saggy."
    Nurse2 "Likewise, your factor also differs in regards to breast growth. Typically, women with a breast growth factor won't lactate unless pregnancy happens to take place on top of the growth."
    Nurse2 "Being that your factor directly involves pregnancy, lactation is somewhat of a given."

    MC "Oh, yeah. Hate that."
    PRG "By doing it this way, I can make sure that I'm getting a taste of everything together."

    "First came the bun, which was toasted lightly on the inside edge, probably with the classic buttered bun on a hot grill method."
    "Next came the burger patty itself. It was perfectly juicy, with just a hint of seasoning. On top of it was the sweet melted cheddar cheese, the flavor of which shining through perfectly."
    "To follow came the lettuce, onion, tomato, and pickles, each one bringing its own flavor to the forefront. The lettuce set a base, the tomato and pickles brought in a bit of bitterness and tartness together, followed up by the intense blast of onion flavor."
    "To top off the flavoring gangbang that was going on in my mouth came the ketchup and mayonnaise on the burger. Both of them gave just a hint of flavor over the top of everything, without overpowering anything."
    "If anything, the two condiments seemed to meld together for unique flavor to themselves."

    MC "Ooh... I'm never going to be able to eat an unorganized burger again."
    PRG "It's good, right?"

    PRG "Um... next is the lettuce. And... it's lettuce. There isn't really anything special about it. It is fresh and crunchy, though."
    PRG "Then... there's the tomato. This one seems to be a beefsteak tomato."
    MC "Beefsteak tomato? Like the tomato tastes like steak?"
    PRG "N-No. That's just what the tomato is called. Usually, beefsteak tomatoes are bigger, with way less seeds than a regular tomato."

    MC "Shoot. You're making me wish I'd ordered bacon on my burger."
    MC "Is there anything else to it besides the B, the L, and the T?"
