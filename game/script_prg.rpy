    "As the bell rang once more, Aida and Sakura sprung into action. Aida deftly measured out a cup of rice and, rather than using a vegetable steamer, filled a pot with water and left it to boil on the stovetop."
    "Sakura flung open a nearby cabinet door and pulled out flour, curry powder, and olive oil."
    "She laid her items on the counter and ducked into a lower cupboard, retrieving a large, deep pot and a frying pan. Working fast, Sakura flipped a burner to medium-high heat and began to fry her ingredients together."
    "As Sakura fried, she quickly stewed vegetables, beef roast, and chicken breast all together. Her timing was impeccable, as both her frying curry and stewing ingredients finished simultaneously."
    "While her water boiled, Aida began working on the mochi. She added mochiko and water together, and mixed them before putting them in yet another pan on the stove."
    "Soon, they formed a thick paste, and she removed the paste from the pan and placed it onto a cutting board."
    "Sakura worked around Aida as she added her now finished roux into her enormous pot."
    "She combined the roux with the stewed ingredients into the pot and slowly simmered them until the entire mixture was thickened. She left the pot on a low heat to hold temperature."
    "Aida's mochi was finally coming together as she added it to a plate and slid it into the fridge to chill. By now, her water was at a rolling boil."
    "Steam curled lavishly from the top as her rice was added and she began stirring, salting the mixture occasionally."
    "Next to her, Sakura retrieved her fish filets from the fridge and began deftly removing the tender fish's meat from the skin. She sliced the filets into nice, plump pieces and arranged them on a large plate in a floral pattern."
    "I glanced across the room to the opposing teams. Compared to Aida and Sakura, their dishes weren't nearly as extravagant."
    "One team was working on tonkatsu ramen with a simple bowl of white rice for an appetizer, and some sort of fancy looking rolled pastry thing filled with a white custard type substance, all of which was covered in chocolate."
    WG "That combination will not sit well."

    MC "Oh, good morning, Alice! What's wrong with that combination?"
    WG "The appetizer and main course will mesh quite nicely, if not a tad too simple for my tastes. Where that pair has gone wrong is in their dessert choice."
    MC "What even is that? I've never seen that kind of dessert before."
    WG "It's called a cannoli. It's an Italian dessert, and quite an upper class one at that. It's a pastry, usually filled with a sweet cream, such as ricotta cheese."
    MC "Are they usually chocolate covered?"
    WG "Not traditionally, but I assume they are trying a home-style recipe out of that. But, they've made a grave error with that, as well."
    MC "How do you mean? They've only added chocolate to it. How can anyone screw that up?"
    show WG haughty
    WG "Exactly. It seems simple. However, that simplicity is what just ruined their dessert. You see, adding a liquid to a pastry isn't that complex, but the timing is."
    WG "If they had placed it into a cup, and served the liquid chocolate alongside their cannoli, that would've been much better. But, now that the chocolate is going to be sitting on that cannoli for almost half an hour..."
    MC "The pastry will get soggy, right?"
    WG "Precisely. They'll be lucky if their cannoli is anything more than soup by the time the judges get a taste of it."

    MC "I've never even seen that in person."
    WG "And for good reason. It's a delicacy, the ultimate in Japanese dining. What's more, it originated from tea ceremonies, where it's serving required an inhuman-like attention to detail and precision."
    WG "And tea ceremonies, as you probably know, are an affair unto themselves. They're taking on too much for this contest."

    "Meanwhile, Aida was draining the water from her rice, taking care to avoid the steam."
    "She transferred her rice to a nearby bowl while Sakura promptly covered the rice with her curry. They set their bowl to the side as Aida retrieved her mochi from the fridge."
    "The mochi was a shallow pink color and looked light and fluffy, yet held its form. Aida dusted the tops of them with powdered sugar, as Sakura took them one by one, and added them to a separate plate."
    "Finally, Sakura placed the sushi and mochi back into the fridge, leaving the kare-raisu on a warming plate on the counter to keep its temperature. The two of them shared a gleeful high five."

    Nurse "It's incredibly hazy... but... it seems that you have at least six babies growing inside of you."
    PRG "W-What?!"
    Nurse "I can't be certain now. That haze is obscuring a lot of the image, most likely it's just a fluid buildup. Sometimes, these buildups can mess with the ultrasound's image just a bit. So, for all we know, there could be less than six."
    MC "But... could there be more than six?"
    "There was a long, awkward pause."
    Nurse "Quite possibly. But for now, I'll confirm that you're pregnant with at least five babies. What appears to be the sixth one could very well be the fluid disrupting our machine."

    "Aida giggled and shuffled forward, heaving one thick leg over to mount me. Then, her whole body leaned forward, pressing more than just her boobs against me. I felt her hand grab my rod as she positioned me correctly."
    "Then, she sat back slowly, my cock easily slipping inside of her. There was a soft, padded thump sound as she took my entire member and her lips made contact with the base of my cock."

    MC "H-Haaaaahh! Aaahhh!"
    "I'd been anticipating that I'd be the one doing most of the work, but I was completely wrong."
    "Aida took a position similar to the first time we'd had sex, with her hands on my legs, and began working my cock, bouncing up and down on it as best as she could."
    "For her size, she moved easily, going up and down nearly as fast as she had the first time. However, this time was infinitely better, mainly because I had her enormous belly tantalizingly close to my face the entire time."
    PRG "Haah! So thick! G-God, Keisuke! Y-You're stretching me out!"
    "Whenever Aida would go up, I'd hold myself still for her. But, each time she came down, I rocketed myself upwards, thrusting my dick into her hard."
    "What was just as satisfying was the sound of the cowbell that was still around Aida's neck, dinging heavily with each thrust."
    "Her boobs were bouncing wildly, pounding up and down on her chest like two overfilled sandbags. In the back, her ass seemed to fit perfectly, coming down onto my thighs and squishing me ever so slightly."
    "But, the centerpiece of it all was her belly, obscuring most of my vision and shifting with her every move. I couldn't help but lay both hands on it as we went at it."
    "However, since her belly wasn't tight, it moved much more freely than a normal pregnant belly would. Of course, I was handling the precious goods with the utmost care, but I loved watching it move like waves in a storm."
    MC "Aida! I-I'm gonna-"
    PRG "Not yet!"
    "Aida lifted herself off of me and laid down hard next to me, plowing her face into the pillow."
    PRG "More! More! Do me more!"
    "I just couldn't say no. Plus, her belly jacked her pussy up into the air so nicely. It looked like a gate awaiting my entrance, and I was clear for landing."
    "I moved behind her and penetrated her, feeling myself go even deeper into her than I had before. Her ass bowed and slapped back at me with each thrust I put into her, giving a resounding smack against my pelvis."
    "My balls swung forward and smacked against her clit, leaving some of her juices on my sack."
    PRG "More! More! Haaaaaghhhh!!"
    "Aida's entire vagina contracted around my cock as she came hard, squeezing my dick tight before relaxing around it. I shut my eyes, trying to avoid cumming myself as I focused more on drilling into her."

    "I moaned loudly as I drained into Aida, feeling her pussy still lightly constricting around me."
    "I could feel my heart pounding in my eardrums as I finally emptied, and slid myself out of Aida, falling onto the bed beside her and panting like a dog."

    "Light streamed through Aida's window as I blinked groggily. The DVD menu music of 'The Sparkling' was playing on repeat on the TV. We must've passed out before the movie had finished."
    "Aida had fallen asleep right beside me, and I was turned inward, spooning her. My dick, while flaccid, was nestled comfortably between her two, billowy ass cheeks."
    "My arms were around her, holding her close. One hand, the one on top, was holding onto her belly, as if I'd been guarding my treasure during the night."
    "My other hand apparently had a different agenda, because it was clinging to her right boob, her nipple poking out from between my fingers."
    "I could tell without even looking that Aida was in serious need of a milking. Her breast felt solid and heavy in my hand, her nipple erect and almost slightly moist to the touch."
    "I sighed happily, and nestled myself a bit closer to her, leaning against her warm body. She was snoring softly, although it was more of a light audible breathing than a deep, rolling snore."
    "I laid my chin on top of her head and put my head back onto the pillow, holding her as she slept. I couldn't help but feel like a sort of protector for her, watching over her while she was asleep. Not just her, but our babies too."
    "As she slept, I gave her big belly the tiniest of squeezes, feeling the soft padding under my hand. I was amazed by her growth."
    "Whereas some girls here only had one part of their body that grew, like Shiori and her ass, Aida had a sort of deluxe package kind of deal."
    "Not many girls were like her, with her big booty, udder-like tits, and an absolute unit of a belly. Aida's growth seemed so strange for someone like her, but at the same time, it seemed to fit her perfectly."
    "She had the innocence and caring attitude of a mother, that was for sure. She'd never even insulted anyone, as far as I'd seen."
    "But, on the other side of the coin was this dark underbelly. Behind her sweetness was an unrelenting kinkiness and an almost insatiable desire for sex."
    "Plus, as she had demonstrated last night, she was no stranger to the more far out ends of the sex spectrum. She was kinky, no doubt, and in a way that no one would ever know unless they really got to know her."
    "In my arms, Aida shifted in her sleep, mumbling softly under her breath."
    PRG "Hnngh... mmm..."
    "I looked at the clock on Aida's nightstand. It was only 8:30 in the morning, and lord knows how late we'd been up last night. The fact that Aida was still out wasn't a surprise to me."
    "I craned my neck to peer around Aida's room. I only realized then that I'd never paid much attention to the actual decor of it. It was simple, like most college dorms, but she had still clearly put a bit of work into it."
    "On her desk were all of her notebooks, and her bag hanging neatly from her chair. Next to the notebooks were a few picture frames that I could make out."
    "I squinted to see them from my current pinned down position. One had a much younger looking Aida and a bigger man sitting in some stadium chairs."
    "Aida was on the man's lap and they were both wearing matching hats, the Dragon's logo emblazoned on them."
    "The man looked to be fairly young, probably around late twenties. He had a light mustache and a faint bit of growth on his chin, as well. No doubt this was Aida's father."
    "In a frame beside it was another photo. This one had Aida and a woman standing over a baking tin together. The tin held an insanely good looking cake, which the woman was helping Aida frost."
    "The woman looked to be a near identical copy of Aida. Their hair color was the same, and their eyes had the same sort of stormy color to them. The woman also looked to be rather bottom heavy, with a skinny top half and some rather blossomed hips."
    "What surprised me most was her hair. In her hair were two hair ties with bright purple balls on each one. She had the ties done in a way that her hair matched Aida's hair now."
    "I looked down at Aida, and examined her ties. They looked to be the same as the ones in the photo."
    MCT "These must've been a gift from her mother. That's probably why she almost never takes them out."
    "Beside the second photo was another frame. This one was more of a portrait style photo with Aida and an older looking couple posed together."
    "The couple was sitting in chairs with Aida behind them, her hands laid gracefully on the older woman's shoulder."
    "Aida looked to be a bit older than in the last couple of photos. She had her hair down and draped over her shoulders, and was wearing a light blue dress."

    "Hearing about Aida's hair ties brought me a sort of relieved feeling. I'd always thought it was a bit strange that Aida's family had sent her away when her dad got sick. Like, couldn't they have just explained his condition to her?"
    "At first, I'd considered that decision to be heartless, but now hearing that short story made me realize what they were trying to do. Make the best of Aida's situation and try to give her a semi-normal upbringing."

    MC "Okay. But, why go through all of that? Why not just heat them all at one time?"
    Sakura "Oh, for one big reason. You know how, when you're eating an apple, it's usually crisp and pretty solid, but when you eat an orange, it's soft and squishy?"
    MC "Yeah?"
    Sakura "That's because each fruit has its own texture. Think like a banana compared to a peach. One is soft and dry, the other is squishy and juicy."
    Sakura "Vegetables kind of work the same way. Kodama-chan is cooking them in order of texture. So, since carrots and onions are more dense, they take longer to actually cook thoroughly."
    Sakura "On the opposite end, zucchini is really soft and juicy, so you barely need to cook them at all."
    MC "So, if Aida would've put all of the veggies in the pan at one time, she'd have to choose between having correctly done zucchini and only seared onions and carrots, or vice versa?"

        RM "So, what's the point in competing now? They've already qualified. It's pointless to just add on more stress."
        MC "I know. But, Aida doesn't see it that way. She's out for more experience, and she sees this competition as a way to learn more."

        MC "But, they both want to win. You can see it clearly. And, the pressure for them to win could drive them down."
        RM "But, wouldn't that same pressure be there even if Myoga-san was cooking?"

        RM "Okay, if worse comes to worst, what's at stake here? What happens if they lose?"

        RM "And, is Kodama-san stressing over this too?"
        MC "Yeah. She's been trying her absolute hardest, both to teach Honoka and making sure that she's prepared for today. But, I think the pressure is eating away at her. Trying to balance both just isn't working."

    Nurse "And, coming to a final conclusion about your size without extensive research is next to impossible, especially considering how diversified your factor is."
    show PRG worried
    PRG "Diversified?"
    Nurse "For instance, consider someone with a breast factor. Their factor will cause growth in their breasts, obviously. And, if someone has a hair growth factor, then the factor will, logically, only make their hair grow."
    Nurse "What I'm trying to say is that, usually, the factor only affects one part of the body, and it keeps itself there."
    Nurse "Your factor, however, is different. Yours seems to incorporate every part of a woman's body that would grow during the time of gestation."
    Nurse "And, your growth from this factor, while similar to other factors, isn't always the same on the inside."
    Nurse "Let's take a weight gain factor, for example. This factor, true to its nature, causes many parts of the body to swell. In essence, every part of the body will be affected. All of the ones that contain fat, anyway."
    Nurse "And generally, a lot of weight gain factors will put quite an emphasis on the abdomen of that person, causing it to grow and distend quite a bit."
    Nurse "However, as I'm sure you already know, a belly on someone with a weight gain factor, and a belly on someone with your factor, are very different."
    MC "Because the girl with the weight gain factor is holding fat, and the girl with Aida's factor is holding babies?"
    Nurse "Exactly, Hotsure-san. It's really not too complicated. The difference is easily seen from the shape differences. A weight gain factor would cause a more saggy, and I don't like this term, but a flabbier belly."
    Nurse "Whereas with you, Kodama-san. Your abdomen isn't saggy."
    Nurse "Likewise, your factor also differs in regards to breast growth. Typically, women with a breast growth factor won't lactate unless pregnancy happens to take place on top of the growth."

    "To follow came the lettuce, onion, tomato, and pickles, each one bringing its own flavor to the forefront. The lettuce set a base, the tomato and pickles brought in a bit of bitterness and tartness together, followed up by the intense blast of onion flavor."
    "To top off the flavoring gangbang that was going on in my mouth came the ketchup and mayonnaise on the burger. Both of them gave just a hint of flavor over the top of everything, without overpowering anything."
