    Takamura "I would like you to take a minute, Hotsure-san. And think about her."
    Takamura "She's a quiet girl who came here alone. She knew no one, and she had no idea what was about to come her way, the entire idea of a \"growth factor\" being a new, and likely an almost unbelievable phenomenon to her."
    Takamura "She learns her factor and learns that it's the rarest and one of the most life altering of all."
    Takamura "She meets someone, a man, who she likes and sees as someone who she can grow closer to, so she does."
    Takamura "Then, her factor kicks in, and due to it, it forces her into a moment of passion that she couldn't control."
    Takamura "Of course... well, you know the rest."
    Takamura "And, as much as I hate to say it, people tend to talk. Rumors spread. And, just like that, most of the academy knows about the one woman on campus dealing with a pregnancy growth factor."

    Takamura "I'd also bet that she's worried about rushing things, given how her factor essentially rushed things along for her."

    MC "I... you're very right."
    Takamura "Now, I should say as well, everything that I'm telling you is simply my point of view. I would never try to tell you or Kodama-san how to conduct your relationship, nor how to handle the situation with your parents."
    Takamura "You both are adults, and those choices are yours alone to make."
    Takamura "I... I suppose you could say that I've... thought a great deal about how Kodama-san must be feeling, and I simply would like to help her in any way that I can."
    Takamura "And, I also must say, I carry a great deal of respect for you, Hotsure-san."
    Takamura "You've stood by her through quite a few harsh moments. That speaks volumes on your character."
    Takamura "And, I don't doubt that Kodama-san is quite grateful for that, as well."

    "Whenever Aida would go up, I'd hold myself still for her. But, each time she came down, I rocketed myself upwards, thrusting my dick into her hard."
    "What was just as satisfying was the sound of the cowbell that was still around Aida's neck, dinging heavily with each thrust."
    "Her boobs were bouncing wildly, pounding up and down on her chest like two overfilled sandbags. In the back, her ass seemed to fit perfectly, coming down onto my thighs and squishing me ever so slightly."
    "But, the centerpiece of it all was her belly, obscuring most of my vision and shifting with her every move. I couldn't help but lay both hands on it as we went at it."
    "However, since her belly wasn't tight, it moved much more freely than a normal pregnant belly would. Of course, I was handling the precious goods with the utmost care, but I loved watching it move like waves in a storm."

    "Aida had fallen asleep right beside me, and I was turned inward, spooning her. My dick, while flaccid, was nestled comfortably between her two, billowy ass cheeks."
    "My arms were around her, holding her close. One hand, the one on top, was holding onto her belly, as if I'd been guarding my treasure during the night."
    "My other hand apparently had a different agenda, because it was clinging to her right boob, her nipple poking out from between my fingers."
    "I could tell without even looking that Aida was in serious need of a milking. Her breast felt solid and heavy in my hand, her nipple erect and almost slightly moist to the touch."
    "I sighed happily, and nestled myself a bit closer to her, leaning against her warm body. She was snoring softly, although it was more of a light audible breathing than a deep, rolling snore."
    "I laid my chin on top of her head and put my head back onto the pillow, holding her as she slept. I couldn't help but feel like a sort of protector for her, watching over her while she was asleep. Not just her, but our babies too."
    "As she slept, I gave her big belly the tiniest of squeezes, feeling the soft padding under my hand. I was amazed by her growth."
    "Whereas some girls here only had one part of their body that grew, like Shiori and her ass, Aida had a sort of deluxe package kind of deal."
    "Not many girls were like her, with her big booty, udder-like tits, and an absolute unit of a belly. Aida's growth seemed so strange for someone like her, but at the same time, it seemed to fit her perfectly."
    "She had the innocence and caring attitude of a mother, that was for sure. She'd never even insulted anyone, as far as I'd seen."
    "But, on the other side of the coin was this dark underbelly. Behind her sweetness was an unrelenting kinkiness and an almost insatiable desire for sex."
    "Plus, as she had demonstrated last night, she was no stranger to the more far out ends of the sex spectrum. She was kinky, no doubt, and in a way that no one would ever know unless they really got to know her."
    "In my arms, Aida shifted in her sleep, mumbling softly under her breath."
    PRG "Hnngh... mmm..."
    "I looked at the clock on Aida's nightstand. It was only 8:30 in the morning, and lord knows how late we'd been up last night. The fact that Aida was still out wasn't a surprise to me."
    "I craned my neck to peer around Aida's room. I only realized then that I'd never paid much attention to the actual decor of it. It was simple, like most college dorms, but she had still clearly put a bit of work into it."
    "On her desk were all of her notebooks, and her bag hanging neatly from her chair. Next to the notebooks were a few picture frames that I could make out."
    "I squinted to see them from my current pinned down position. One had a much younger looking Aida and a bigger man sitting in some stadium chairs."
    "Aida was on the man's lap and they were both wearing matching hats, the Koi's logo emblazoned on them."
    "The man looked to be fairly young, probably around late twenties. He had a light mustache and a faint bit of growth on his chin, as well. No doubt this was Aida's father."
    "In a frame beside it was another photo. This one had Aida and a woman standing over a baking tin together. The tin held an insanely good looking cake, which the woman was helping Aida frost."
    "The woman looked to be a near identical copy of Aida. Their hair color was the same, and their eyes had the same sort of stormy color to them. The woman also looked to be rather bottom heavy, with a skinny top half and some rather blossomed hips."
    "What surprised me most was her hair. In her hair were two hair ties with bright purple balls on each one. She had the ties done in a way that her hair matched Aida's hair now."
    "I looked down at Aida, and examined her ties. They looked to be the same as the ones in the photo."

    MC "Okay. But, why go through all of that? Why not just heat them all at one time?"
    Sakura "Oh, for one big reason. You know how, when you're eating an apple, it's usually crisp and pretty solid, but when you eat an orange, it's soft and squishy?"
    MC "Yeah?"
    Sakura "That's because each fruit has its own texture. Think like a banana compared to a peach. One is soft and dry, the other is squishy and juicy."
    Sakura "Vegetables kind of work the same way. Kodama-chan is cooking them in order of texture. So, since carrots and onions are more dense, they take longer to actually cook thoroughly."
    Sakura "On the opposite end, zucchini is really soft and juicy, so you barely need to cook them at all."
    MC "So, if Aida would've put all of the veggies in the pan at one time, she'd have to choose between having correctly done zucchini and only seared onions and carrots, or vice versa?"

    "The nurse sighed and looked down at Aida's paperwork."

    Nurse2 "There's precious little information known about the factor. And, a good portion of the information we do have is based on speculation. Not proven fact."
    Nurse2 "There are many different unknowns, as well. Like, the hormonal rush that you likely felt before your pregnancy."
    Nurse2 "What I can say for certain is that no one with a hyperfertility factor has ever gotten this... well, large. It's safe to say that you are in the highest percentile of growth. And, this is..."

    Nurse2 "I unfortunately can't reveal much to you about them. However, what I can tell you is that your latest growth spurt shot you to the top of the charts. I don't think Seichou has ever seen a belly this size."
    Nurse2 "And, coming to a final conclusion about your size without extensive research is next to impossible, especially considering how diversified your factor is."
    show PRG worried
    PRG "Diversified?"
    Nurse2 "For instance, consider someone with a breast factor. Their factor will cause growth in their breasts, obviously. And, if someone has a hair growth factor, then the factor will, logically, only make their hair grow."
    Nurse2 "What I'm trying to say is that, usually, the factor only affects one part of the body, and it keeps itself there."
    Nurse2 "Your factor, however, is different. Yours seems to incorporate every part of a woman's body that would grow during the time of gestation."
    Nurse2 "And, your growth from this factor, while similar to other factors, isn't always the same on the inside."
    Nurse2 "Let's take a weight gain factor, for example. This factor, true to its nature, causes many parts of the body to swell. In essence, every part of the body will be affected. All of the ones that contain fat, anyway."
    Nurse2 "And generally, a lot of weight gain factors will put quite an emphasis on the abdomen of that person, causing it to grow and distend quite a bit."
    Nurse2 "However, as I'm sure you already know, a belly on someone with a weight gain factor, and a belly on someone with your factor, are very different."
    MC "Because the girl with the weight gain factor is holding fat, and the girl with Aida's factor is holding babies?"
    Nurse2 "Exactly, Hotsure-san. It's really not too complicated. The difference is easily seen from the shape differences. A weight gain factor would cause a more saggy, and I don't like this term, but a flabbier belly."
    Nurse2 "Whereas with you, Kodama-san. Your abdomen isn't saggy."
    Nurse2 "Likewise, your factor also differs in regards to breast growth. Typically, women with a breast growth factor won't lactate unless pregnancy happens to take place on top of the growth."
    Nurse2 "Being that your factor directly involves pregnancy, lactation is somewhat of a given."

        PRG "You have a sister?"
        MC "Mhm. Her name is Tomoko. She goes here too. You've probably seen her around before."
        PRG "Maybe. What's she look like?"
        MC "She's got a hair factor like me, so look for the trademark floor length curtain hair. Other than that, she has pale skin and looks like she hasn't seen the sun in centuries."
        PRG "W-Well, I-I don't recognize that description, b-but I'd probably know her if I saw her."
        MC "Yeah, she's something."

        "Once we started nearing the end of them, I noticed Aida reaching for more fries more often, and purposefully slowed myself down. She needed the nourishment more than I did."
        "As nourishing as french fries can be, anyway."
