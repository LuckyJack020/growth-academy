    "On the page was a drawing of two people, a man and a woman by the looks of it, and they were... kissing? Their arms were wrapped around each other in a romance novel style hug, and the man had the woman leaned back slightly into his arms."

    "The woman was shorter than the man, at least by a handful of inches, and she had absolutely enormous breasts."
    "Looking over the rest of her showed that she was a shapely woman everywhere else as well, with thick thighs and a generously proportioned rear end."
    "Turning my focus to the man, he looked oddly simple, with formal pants and a white button down dress shirt."
    "What struck me as odd was his long, flowing hair, which stopped mid-back, and he had the same crest featured on his shirt as the woman did... wait."
    "I looked down at my shirt and stared. There was the crest: the Seichou Academy crest."
    "Reaching behind me, I felt for my hair. While not quite to my mid back, it was surely on its way. Even my dress pants matched the image almost to a tee."
    "Looking over to the girl again revealed little more than what I had previously noticed, until I glanced at her hair and noticed a rather miniscule detail."
    "Tiny purple beads were in her hair, forming the ends into two distinct ponytails, which hung over the shoulder."

    MC "And why was that? Why would they move if they had already established themselves?"
    PRG "Mainly for general game attendance. Aioi only has a population of just over 30,000 people, whereas Himeji has a population of over 500,000."

    WG "It's called a cannoli. It's an Italian dessert, and quite an upper class one at that. It's a pastry, usually filled with a sweet cream, such as ricotta cheese."
    MC "Are they usually chocolate covered?"
    WG "Not traditionally, but I assume they are trying a home-style recipe out of that. But, they've made a grave error with that, as well."

    MC "But... could there be more than six?"

    MCT "Do most sleepwalkers get dressed?"
    "From there, the snapping sound was obviously her window latch, followed by her window actually opening."
    "But, would she have actually crawled out her window? This wasn't Daichi I was talking about, here. Maybe those sounds were from her door being unlatched and opening? Yeah, that made more sense."
    "Then, the squeaking and rustling after the door opened was probably Alice moving after hearing the door open. She shifted in her sleep or something of that nature."
    "Then, all that was left was... that strange rumbling. The only idea I had was maybe Aida got a text or a call from someone else, but that seemed like a long shot, given that it was 3:30 in the morning."
    "Ah, that was it! Alice probably woke up, saw Aida was missing. and called her phone, causing it to vibrate on her nightstand and making that rumbling sound."
    "Now satisfied, I picked up my phone again and unlocked the screen, then just as quickly as my anxiety had left, it was back again. I'd forgotten to set my alarm last night."

    "Aida giggled and shuffled forward, heaving one thick leg over to mount me. Then, her whole body leaned forward, pressing more than just her boobs against me. I felt her hand grab my rod as she positioned me correctly."
    "Then, she sat back slowly, my cock easily slipping inside of her. There was a soft, padded thump sound as she took my entire member and her lips made contact with the base of my cock."

    MC "H-Haaaaahh! Aaahhh!"
    "I'd been anticipating that I'd be the one doing most of the work, but I was completely wrong."
    "Aida took a position similar to the first time we'd had sex, with her hands on my legs, and began working my cock, bouncing up and down on it as best as she could."
    "For her size, she moved easily, going up and down nearly as fast as she had the first time. However, this time was infinitely better, mainly because I had her enormous belly tantalizingly close to my face the entire time."
    PRG "Haah! So thick! G-God, Keisuke! Y-You're stretching me out!"
    "Whenever Aida would go up, I'd hold myself still for her. But, each time she came down, I rocketed myself upwards, thrusting my dick into her hard."
    "What was just as satisfying was the sound of the cowbell that was still around Aida's neck, dinging heavily with each thrust."
    "Her boobs were bouncing wildly, pounding up and down on her chest like two overfilled sandbags. In the back, her ass seemed to fit perfectly, coming down onto my thighs and squishing me ever so slightly."
    "But, the centerpiece of it all was her belly, obscuring most of my vision and shifting with her every move. I couldn't help but lay both hands on it as we went at it."
    "However, since her belly wasn't tight, it moved much more freely than a normal pregnant belly would. Of course, I was handling the precious goods with the utmost care, but I loved watching it move like waves in a storm."
    MC "Aida! I-I'm gonna-"

    "Aida lifted herself off of me and laid down hard next to me, plowing her face into the pillow."
    PRG "More! More! Do me more!"
    "I just couldn't say no. Plus, her belly jacked her pussy up into the air so nicely. It looked like a gate awaiting my entrance, and I was clear for landing."
    "I moved behind her and penetrated her, feeling myself go even deeper into her than I had before. Her ass bowed and slapped back at me with each thrust I put into her, giving a resounding smack against my pelvis."
    "My balls swung forward and smacked against her clit, leaving some of her juices on my sack."
    PRG "More! More! Haaaaaghhhh!!"
    "Aida's entire vagina contracted around my cock as she came hard, squeezing my dick tight before relaxing around it. I shut my eyes, trying to avoid cumming myself as I focused more on drilling into her."

    "Light streamed through Aida's window as I blinked groggily. The DVD menu music of 'The Sparkling' was playing on repeat on the TV. We must've passed out before the movie had finished."
    "Aida had fallen asleep right beside me, and I was turned inward, spooning her. My dick, while flaccid, was nestled comfortably between her two, billowy ass cheeks."
    "My arms were around her, holding her close. One hand, the one on top, was holding onto her belly, as if I'd been guarding my treasure during the night."
    "My other hand apparently had a different agenda, because it was clinging to her right boob, her nipple poking out from between my fingers."
    "I could tell without even looking that Aida was in serious need of a milking. Her breast felt solid and heavy in my hand, her nipple erect and almost slightly moist to the touch."
    "I sighed happily, and nestled myself a bit closer to her, leaning against her warm body. She was snoring softly, although it was more of a light audible breathing than a deep, rolling snore."
    "I laid my chin on top of her head and put my head back onto the pillow, holding her as she slept. I couldn't help but feel like a sort of protector for her, watching over her while she was asleep. Not just her, but our babies too."
    "As she slept, I gave her big belly the tiniest of squeezes, feeling the soft padding under my hand. I was amazed by her growth."
    "Whereas some girls here only had one part of their body that grew, like Shiori and her ass, Aida had a sort of deluxe package kind of deal."
    "Not many girls were like her, with her big booty, udder-like tits, and an absolute unit of a belly. Aida's growth seemed so strange for someone like her, but at the same time, it seemed to fit her perfectly."
    "She had the innocence and caring attitude of a mother, that was for sure. She'd never even insulted anyone, as far as I'd seen."
    "But, on the other side of the coin was this dark underbelly. Behind her sweetness was an unrelenting kinkiness and an almost insatiable desire for sex."
    "Plus, as she had demonstrated last night, she was no stranger to the more far out ends of the sex spectrum. She was kinky, no doubt, and in a way that no one would ever know unless they really got to know her."
    "In my arms, Aida shifted in her sleep, mumbling softly under her breath."
    PRG "Hnngh... mmm..."
    "I looked at the clock on Aida's nightstand. It was only 8:30 in the morning, and lord knows how late we'd been up last night. The fact that Aida was still out wasn't a surprise to me."
    "I craned my neck to peer around Aida's room. I only realized then that I'd never paid much attention to the actual decor of it. It was simple, like most college dorms, but she had still clearly put a bit of work into it."
    "On her desk were all of her notebooks, and her bag hanging neatly from her chair. Next to the notebooks were a few picture frames that I could make out."
    "I squinted to see them from my current pinned down position. One had a much younger looking Aida and a bigger man sitting in some stadium chairs."
    "Aida was on the man's lap and they were both wearing matching hats, the Dragon's logo emblazoned on them."
    "The man looked to be fairly young, probably around late twenties. He had a light mustache and a faint bit of growth on his chin, as well. No doubt this was Aida's father."
    "In a frame beside it was another photo. This one had Aida and a woman standing over a baking tin together. The tin held an insanely good looking cake, which the woman was helping Aida frost."
    "The woman looked to be a near identical copy of Aida. Their hair color was the same, and their eyes had the same sort of stormy color to them. The woman also looked to be rather bottom heavy, with a skinny top half and some rather blossomed hips."
    "What surprised me most was her hair. In her hair were two hair ties with bright purple balls on each one. She had the ties done in a way that her hair matched Aida's hair now."
    "I looked down at Aida, and examined her ties. They looked to be the same as the ones in the photo."
    MCT "These must've been a gift from her mother. That's probably why she almost never takes them out."
    "Beside the second photo was another frame. This one was more of a portrait style photo with Aida and an older looking couple posed together."
    "The couple was sitting in chairs with Aida behind them, her hands laid gracefully on the older woman's shoulder."
    "Aida looked to be a bit older than in the last couple of photos. She had her hair down and draped over her shoulders, and was wearing a light blue dress."

    PRG "So, I wore them almost every day when I was little. Then, when I had to move, I started wearing them not just for the luck, but to remember her, and to have a piece of her everywhere I went."
    "Aida sighed, staring at the photo with one hand on her ties."
    "Hearing about Aida's hair ties brought me a sort of relieved feeling. I'd always thought it was a bit strange that Aida's family had sent her away when her dad got sick. Like, couldn't they have just explained his condition to her?"
    "At first, I'd considered that decision to be heartless, but now hearing that short story made me realize what they were trying to do. Make the best of Aida's situation and try to give her a semi-normal upbringing."

    Sakura "Then, she adds in the softer vegetables, such as zucchini last."
    MC "Okay. But, why go through all of that? Why not just heat them all at one time?"
    Sakura "Oh, for one big reason. You know how, when you're eating an apple, it's usually crisp and pretty solid, but when you eat an orange, it's soft and squishy?"
    MC "Yeah?"
    Sakura "That's because each fruit has its own texture. Think like a banana compared to a peach. One is soft and dry, the other is squishy and juicy."
    Sakura "Vegetables kind of work the same way. Kodama-chan is cooking them in order of texture. So, since carrots and onions are more dense, they take longer to actually cook thoroughly."
    Sakura "On the opposite end, zucchini is really soft and juicy, so you barely need to cook them at all."
    MC "So, if Aida would've put all of the veggies in the pan at one time, she'd have to choose between having correctly done zucchini and only seared onions and carrots, or vice versa?"

    MomCell "That's so good to hear, Honey. I'm proud of you. How did you two meet?"
    MC "On my first day at the Academy, actually. She was cleaning a classroom, and I happened to run into her there. Unfortunately, it wasn't much of a fairy tale meeting."

    MomCell "Okay, Honey. If you're sure."
    MC "Mhm. So, for starters, Aida has one of the rarest factors of all. Like, from what I've heard, there's only a handful of girls who've had this factor in the history of the Academy."
    MomCell "I see. Go on, Dear."
    "I felt like I was trying to rip off a full body bandage. I knew I should've called her and Dad sooner, but the tension and stress of the whole situation had just made me shove my parents into a corner and try to ignore them."
    MC "Well... essentially, her factor gives her hyperfertility, and her actual growth is rooted in that."
    MC "Her factor only really appears if or when she gets pregnant, but when it does, she grows from there."

    MomCell "Well, all you can do is be there for her. I'm not exactly thrilled that you're first telling us this now, but I do have to commend you for being mature about this."
    MC "Thanks, Mom. I can text you a copy of the ultrasound, if you'd like."
    MomCell "Yes, yes, please do. I never thought I'd be seeing my grandchild this early, but I suppose better now than never."
    MC "And... that's the other thing. She's having more than one."

    MC "Mom, I made a commitment to Aida. I'm not leaving her."
    MomCell "I-I didn't necessarily mean that, dear. I was thinking along the lines of adoption or something..."
    MC "We haven't discussed that yet."
    MomCell "I... you're your own man, Keisuke, and I can't tell you what to do anymore. Having said that, I'd strongly consider adoption. You're still so young, and I..."
    MomCell "I just don't want to see you under that level of stress."

    Nurse "And, coming to a final conclusion about your size without extensive research is next to impossible, especially considering how diversified your factor is."
    show PRG worried
    PRG "Diversified?"
    Nurse "For instance, consider someone with a breast factor. Their factor will cause growth in their breasts, obviously. And, if someone has a hair growth factor, then the factor will, logically, only make their hair grow."
    Nurse "What I'm trying to say is that, usually, the factor only affects one part of the body, and it keeps itself there."
    Nurse "Your factor, however, is different. Yours seems to incorporate every part of a woman's body that would grow during the time of gestation."
    Nurse "And, your growth from this factor, while similar to other factors, isn't always the same on the inside."
    Nurse "Let's take a weight gain factor, for example. This factor, true to its nature, causes many parts of the body to swell. In essence, every part of the body will be affected. All of the ones that contain fat, anyway."
    Nurse "And generally, a lot of weight gain factors will put quite an emphasis on the abdomen of that person, causing it to grow and distend quite a bit."
    Nurse "However, as I'm sure you already know, a belly on someone with a weight gain factor, and a belly on someone with your factor, are very different."
    MC "Because the girl with the weight gain factor is holding fat, and the girl with Aida's factor is holding babies?"
    Nurse "Exactly, Hotsure-san. It's really not too complicated. The difference is easily seen from the shape differences. A weight gain factor would cause a more saggy, and I don't like this term, but a flabbier belly."
    Nurse "Whereas with you, Kodama-san. Your abdomen isn't saggy."
    Nurse "Likewise, your factor also differs in regards to breast growth. Typically, women with a breast growth factor won't lactate unless pregnancy happens to take place on top of the growth."
    Nurse "Being that your factor directly involves pregnancy, lactation is somewhat of a given."

    "Notebook and pencil in hand, I was walking down the hall toward the library, mentally going over the countries that I'd have to take notes on today."
    "As soon as the bell had rang to dismiss us from class, Aida had gotten up and rocketed out of the room, most likely heading off towards the library."
    "It seemed like, at long last, things between Aida and I were finally getting back to normal after everything that had transpired."
    "At the very least, Aida had seemed more like her usual self. Yeah, she still shot me deer-in-the-headlights looks quite frequently and she'd almost never speak more than two words at a time, but she seemed more at peace, at least from my point of view."
    "But as far as my own feelings, I still had the lingering burn of that weird, slumpy feeling inside of me. Some days, I felt perfectly fine, just like any other day."
    "But I still had a large number of mornings where I just felt ransacked and dead from the neck up. Most of the time, the feelings seemed to fade by the time the afternoon rolled around, but still, I would've much preferred the feelings stay away altogether."
    "I opened the library door and headed in, bound and determined to get some work done. If I focused on my goals, it would probably help my head. Eyes on the prize, as some philosopher probably said once."

    "Silently trying to reject my lack of a social life, I headed in and took a seat at the same computer from yesterday. Aida wasn't here yet, so I figured I could try and get a head start."
    "As I logged in and began searching up information on Bulgaria, my stomach rolled."
    "I hadn't really been hungry for lunch, but seeing all of these traditional Bulgarian food photos was really stirring the metaphorical hunger pot."
    "To take my mind away from the photos, I found a few articles from food critics and started writing light notes from their writings, making sure to copy the source of the article into an online document for later use."
    "Around half an hour later, and I had a full page on Bulgaria, half a page on Scotland, and a hunger pang ridden stomach."
    "Finally submitting to my unwanted urges, I got up and slid my notebook into my bag, pushing my bag under the desk where no one would bother it."

    "I made a quick mental note to make a trip there at some point."

    "The restaurant was fairly small, but felt cozy and relaxed all the same. A few booths and tables were placed sparingly around the dining room in a way that allowed space to walk between the tables."
    "I wondered if they'd arranged everything this way for the sake of the students of Seichou and their unique spatial requirements, or if it was just a funny coincidence."

    PRG "T-That's so I can make sure that I'll taste a little bit of everything at once. You know how sometimes you take a bite of a sandwich, and all you get is the bread with a dash of mayonnaise on it?"
    MC "Oh, yeah. Hate that."
    PRG "By doing it this way, I can make sure that I'm getting a taste of everything together."
    "Picking up my burger again, I spun it in my hand until I found the even side, gently plucking a piece of lettuce and sliding it back into place before taking a bite."
    MC "Mmm..."
    "With everything perfectly arranged, each ingredient hit my tongue in sequence, rather than a jumble of chaotic ingredients mish-mashed together."
    "First came the bun, which was toasted lightly on the inside edge, probably with the classic buttered bun on a hot grill method."
    "Next came the burger patty itself. It was perfectly juicy, with just a hint of seasoning. On top of it was the sweet melted cheddar cheese, the flavor of which shining through perfectly."
    "To follow came the lettuce, onion, tomato, and pickles, each one bringing its own flavor to the forefront. The lettuce set a base, the tomato and pickles brought in a bit of bitterness and tartness together, followed up by the intense blast of onion flavor."
    "To top off the flavoring gangbang that was going on in my mouth came the ketchup and mayonnaise on the burger. Both of them gave just a hint of flavor over the top of everything, without overpowering anything."
    "If anything, the two condiments seemed to meld together for unique flavor to themselves."
    PRG "How is it?"
    MC "Ooh... I'm never going to be able to eat an unorganized burger again."
    PRG "It's good, right?"
    MC "Mhm! Everything hits so perfectly in order. This is insane."
    "I took another bite, only to receive the same result. I was witnessing perfection in burger form."

    MC "What?! People do that?!"
    PRG "Y-Yeah! I've only heard of it being done with grilled cheese, but you can taste the difference in the bread."
    MC "Wow. Who knew? Anyway, what else do you taste?"
    PRG "Um... next is the lettuce. And... it's lettuce. There isn't really anything special about it. It is fresh and crunchy, though."
    PRG "Then... there's the tomato. This one seems to be a beefsteak tomato."
    MC "Beefsteak tomato? Like the tomato tastes like steak?"
    PRG "N-No. That's just what the tomato is called. Usually, beefsteak tomatoes are bigger, with way less seeds than a regular tomato."
    MC "Ah."
    PRG "Then, the bacon completes the whole sandwich. It adds the saltiness to the whole sandwich, plus the usual bacon flavor."
    MC "How is the bacon done?"
    PRG "It's right between crispy and tender. Right where I like it."
    MC "Shoot. You're making me wish I'd ordered bacon on my burger."
    MC "Is there anything else to it besides the B, the L, and the T?"
    PRG "There is mayonnaise too. Some people hate mayo on a BLT, but I like it."
    "She took another bite or the sandwich."
    PRG "There's a lot of varieties to the BLT though too."
