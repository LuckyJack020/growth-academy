    PRG "The pits pull right out on them, you'll see when you cut them open, otherwise you'll be wasting a lot of fruit trying to free the pit from the peach."
    PRG "I mean those other kinds are fine for eating plain, but they aren't the best for baking."
    PRG "Now we're going to want to peel the skin off. Peaches are really soft, so make sure the peeler isn't dull or it'll drag too much."

    PRG "I know they say most of the nutrients are in the skin, but it's a dessert— we can worry about nutrition later. You really don't want that leathery texture in the dish."
    "I ended up peeling about five peaches and cutting them up into wedges."
    PRG "That looks really good, Hotsure-san. Now if we just left it as is, the dish would be sweet, but that's about it. We need a few extra things to really make it shine."
    PRG "Grate in about a quarter lemon's worth of lemon zest, careful not to get any of the white pith in there. A quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, and just a dash each of allspice and clove."
    "Aida's insights from her experience were exactly what I needed to make sure this effort was going to be a hit with Alice; her discerning palette would definitely pick up on the added complexity from including these spices."
    PRG "Alright, set aside the bowl of peaches for the moment. Now's the part where we dial up the sweetness!"
    MCT "I like the sound of this."
    PRG "In the sauce pan, make a simple syrup with equal parts water and sugar. It doesn't look like all that sugar is going to dissolve, but just give it a couple of minutes at high heat and you'll see."
    "I was skeptical at first, but after only a few minutes, that white grainy blob I dropped into the water became a shimmering clear liquid."
    PRG "Okay, now add the peaches. We're not trying to cook them yet. That'll happen later in the oven. We just want them to get coated and ooze out their flavor to make a peach syrup."
    "Peaches had never been my favorite fruit, but after letting them sit in the hot syrup a bit, the whole kitchen smelled amazing."
    "It looked way more appetizing than the canned peaches in syrup goop at the store, even if it was technically the same thing. It made me feel good about taking the extra effort to do this myself."
    PRG "Okay, next is the batter, but before we start on that, let's get the dutch oven going on the range."
    PRG "Set it to low heat and put two sticks of butter into it. It should all be melted by the time we're done with the batter."
    MCT "Two whole sticks of butter? Alice is {i}really{/i} going to like this."
    PRG "Mix the sugar, flour, and milk in a bowl with a whisk. This is a good batter to start out with because it's very thin, so it's not hard to mix and you're not going to over mix it."
    MC "Seems easy enough, but what do you mean about over mixing? How is that possible?"
    PRG "Oh, it's a really common mistake, actually. If you've ever had a cake–based dessert that came out with a chewy, leathery texture when it was supposed to be light and airy, that's what happened."
    MC "Ah, gotcha. That's probably one of the reasons why Alice isn't satisfied with the quality of the desserts at the cafeteria."
    PRG "Probably, yeah."
    PRG "Anyway, that looks good. Gently pour it into the butter in the dutch oven. You don't want to mix it, just let it settle on the butter."
    PRG "Now do the same for the peaches and syrup. Gently ladle them on top, we don't want to mix it. The batter will rise as it cooks, slowly burying the peaches as it bubbles up."
    PRG "You want the texture contrast and varying consistency with this kind of kind of dessert that you can't get if you just whipped everything together."
    "Trying to follow Aida's instructions to a T, I put the peaches in slow, like {i}super{/i} slow. I probably didn't need to be that deliberate, but I came too far to screw this up now."
    show PRG happy
    PRG "That's perfect, Hotsure-san! It's ready for the oven. Go ahead and put it in."
    "The cast iron dutch oven was heavier than I expected. If I wasn't being cautious I'd have probably dumped the whole thing as I slid it into the oven."
    MC "Okay, that's that. How long is that going to take?"
    PRG "Well, if I had to say from experience, probably about an hour, but with baking you can't just rely on the timer, you have to watch with your eyes too. You're looking for the crust to be golden brown and the syrup to be bubbling around the edges."
    "Looking into the oven, all I saw was a butter batter mosaic of peach goo in a pot. It obviously had quite a ways to go."
    MC "Well that leaves some time to kill. It works out too because Alice should be back by then. What should we do in the meantime?"

    PRG "Oh, not that one, here let me show you where—"

    "I was determined to do it myself so I could do it on my own if I had to."

    PRG "That's a great way of looking at things, Hotsure-san."
    PRG "Okay, while we're waiting on that, we can make the crust. It's really easy, just smash up these graham crackers and mix in some melted butter."
    MC "That's it? No like fancy spiced crumble or some kind of special Italian biscotti? Just crackers?"
    PRG "I know it sounds cheap, but believe me, nothing else is as good for getting that classic cheesecake flavor."
    "Well, I wasn't in any position to know better, so I melted a stick of butter on the stove and added it to the pulverized crackers until I got a consistency like wet sand I could mold into a crust."
    PRG "Alright, now coat the bottom and the edges of a springform pan. It's pretty much the only thing those are ever used for."
    PRG "But first, make sure you grease the edges or it'll be a sticky mess when you go to release it from the mold."

    "The microwave indicated it had taken the chill off the cream cheese."
    PRG "Okay, now we have to cream it."
    MC "What? I thought it was already cream cheese?"
    PRG "Well it is, but it's kind of different. In baking it's referring to incorporating sugar into a fat source like butter, or in this case, cream cheese. Here."
    "Aida handed me a big wooden spoon."
    PRG "You'll see why you want this to be at room temperature. Smash the sugar into it until it's all one consistency."
    "Aida wasn't kidding, the cream cheese was still kind of cool. Trying to smash it all around in a bowl to get the sugar to dissolve into it felt like mixing concrete with a garden trowel."
    "After mixing until my hand nearly froze shut, it looked pretty well mixed."
    PRG "Alright, now we need to add four eggs."
    MC "Four eggs, got it."
    "I proceeded to crack four eggs into a bowl, trying to make sure I didn't get any eggshells in there."
    MCT "No shells, looking good. In ya go!"
    PRG "No wait! You can't add them in all at once. It has to be one at a time."
    MC "Really? Why's that?"
    PRG "It tempers the mixture. Eggs help bind everything together, but if you add too much too soon, they don't end up mixing correctly and it breaks when the protein and fat separate."
    MC "Ah, gotcha."
    "Admittedly I didn't get it, but I was sure glad Aida was watching over me or I would have ruined this thing five times over by now."
    PRG "Only mix just enough to get it incorporated in. Cheesecake is supposed to be dense, we don't want any extra air in it."
    PRG "Now for the special ingredients. In a separate bowl add some flour and sour cream."
    MC "Sour what? Are you serious? I don't want it to taste sour."
    PRG "Don't worry, it won't. It's not much, but the little extra tang in the background is a welcome addition in something as rich as a cheesecake. It helps to make it more palatable."
    MC "Okay but if you tell me to add fish sauce to this then I'm really going to get suspicious."

    PRG "Okay, after that, we're going to add vanilla, and the zest of a fourth of an orange and a fourth of a lemon too. It's these subtle touches that really make a dessert pop, instead of just being a single note of sweetness."
    PRG "Mix it all in, but not too much, remember? Then it's ready to pour into the pan."
    "The viscous filling oozed over the edge of the bowl as I gently poured it into the prepared pan with the crust. With the added eggs and citrus zest, the bright white color of the cream cheese had taken on a slightly orange/yellow hue to it."
    PRG "Alright that goes in for about one hour. It might take a little less, you're really just looking for it to not be jiggly in the center anymore."
    MC "Great, so it'll be ready in just an hour?"
    PRG "Oh no, it takes four hours to cool off in the oven after you turn it off, or else it'll start cracking."

    PRG "We can make a raspberry compote while we're waiting on it to cook. The tartness of the raspberries will help cut the richness of the cheesecake, making it taste less intense."
    MCT "All I heard was \"It'll have Alice wanting to eat more cheesecake.\""
    MC "Well, we got time to kill anyway. Let's get to work."
    "There wasn't much to the rest of it, just some sugar, raspberries, water, and citrus peels added to a pot that I stirred for most of an hour."
