    WG "I'm assuming both of you are at least somewhat familiar with the rules of volleyball?"
    PRG "A little..."
    MC "Yeah, but it's been a while."
    WG "That's fine, we'll just stick with the basics. The obvious rules are you can't catch the ball, and the goal is to not let the ball touch the ground on your side."
    WG "You can't have any successive contacts with the ball, so you need to either send it over the net or pass it to a teammate. In sand volleyball only three total contacts are allowed per volley, but we'll ignore that for now."
    WG "The main skills you need to know are the forearm pass, and the set. These will help you keep the ball in the air and off the ground- even if you don't know anything else."
    MC "Gotcha."
    WG "First I'll show you the set."
    "Alice tossed the ball straight up, bringing her hands close together over her head, nearly touching her fingertips together she pushed it straight back up in the air once it came back down and made contact with her hands."
    "She did this a few times in a row, each time perfectly straight up, never taking her eyes off the ball as she continued to explain."
    WG "The trick is to use more of your fingers and not so much of your palms. This is mostly a set up move for your partner to line up a good shot over the net, which is why you want it to just float up and have a simple trajectory."
    "Alice caught the ball and cradled it against her side after finishing her demonstration."
    WG "Make sense?"
    MC "Yeah, easy enough, I guess."
    PRG "I think so."
    WG "Good. The next main skill is called the forearm pass. As the name implies this lets you control the direction better when you return a volley in order to pass it to your teammate."
    "Alice tossed the ball straight up again. She brought her hands together with one hand cradling a fist made with the other while she kept her arms straight."
    "The ball landed on the lower part of her forearms as she bumped it back up into the air. This time she had to adjust her placement a little bit as the ball moved more from side to side."
    "It still wasn't much repositioning though. Her control was excellent."
    WG "You want to make contact with your forearms. If it hits your wrist or hands, you have no control over how it will bounce off, and if it hits your upper arms, it won't go very far at all."

    WG "Got that?"

    MC "I may not be that accurate, but I know how to spike the ball and I have a height advantage on her. If I get the ball, I'll pass it to you, then you pass it to me."
    MC "If you can give me a nice gentle pass, I'll have the time to figure out where I want to put the ball and I'll fire it to the opposite of where she's standing on the court."

    PRG "I mean those other kinds are fine for eating plain, but they aren't the best for baking."
    PRG "Now we're going to want to peel the skin off. Peaches are really soft, so make sure the peeler isn't dull or it'll drag too much."

    PRG "I know they say most of the nutrients are in the skin, but it's a dessert— we can worry about nutrition later. You really don't want that leathery texture in the dish."
    "I ended up peeling about five peaches and cutting them up into wedges."
    PRG "That looks really good, Hotsure-san. Now if we just left it as is, the dish would be sweet, but that's about it. We need a few extra things to really make it shine."
    PRG "Grate in about a quarter lemon's worth of lemon zest, careful not to get any of the white pith in there. A quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, and just a dash each of allspice and clove."
    "Aida's insights from her experience were exactly what I needed to make sure this effort was going to be a hit with Alice; her discerning palette would definitely pick up on the added complexity from including these spices."
    PRG "Alright, set aside the bowl of peaches for the moment. Now's the part where we dial up the sweetness!"
    MCT "I like the sound of this."
    PRG "In the sauce pan, make a simple syrup with equal parts water and sugar. It doesn't look like all that sugar is going to dissolve, but just give it a couple of minutes at high heat and you'll see."
    "I was skeptical at first, but after only a few minutes, that white grainy blob I dropped into the water became a shimmering clear liquid."
    PRG "Okay, now add the peaches. We're not trying to cook them yet. That'll happen later in the oven. We just want them to get coated and ooze out their flavor to make a peach syrup."
    "Peaches had never been my favorite fruit, but after letting them sit in the hot syrup a bit, the whole kitchen smelled amazing."
    "It looked way more appetizing than the canned peaches in syrup goop at the store, even if it was technically the same thing. It made me feel good about taking the extra effort to do this myself."
    PRG "Okay, next is the batter, but before we start on that, let's get the dutch oven going on the range."
    PRG "Set it to low heat and put two sticks of butter into it. It should all be melted by the time we're done with the batter."
    MCT "Two whole sticks of butter? Alice is {i}really{/i} going to like this."
    PRG "Mix the sugar, flour, and milk in a bowl with a whisk. This is a good batter to start out with because it's very thin, so it's not hard to mix and you're not going to over mix it."
    MC "Seems easy enough, but what do you mean about over mixing? How is that possible?"
    PRG "Oh, it's a really common mistake, actually. If you've ever had a cake–based dessert that came out with a chewy, leathery texture when it was supposed to be light and airy, that's what happened."
    MC "Ah, gotcha. That's probably one of the reasons why Alice isn't satisfied with the quality of the desserts at the cafeteria."
    PRG "Probably, yeah."
    PRG "Anyway, that looks good. Gently pour it into the butter in the dutch oven. You don't want to mix it, just let it settle on the butter."
    PRG "Now do the same for the peaches and syrup. Gently ladle them on top, we don't want to mix it. The batter will rise as it cooks, slowly burying the peaches as it bubbles up."
    PRG "You want the texture contrast and varying consistency with this kind of kind of dessert that you can't get if you just whipped everything together."
    "Trying to follow Aida's instructions to a T, I put the peaches in slow, like {i}super{/i} slow. I probably didn't need to be that deliberate, but I came too far to screw this up now."

    PRG "That's a great way of looking at things, Hotsure-san."
    PRG "Okay, while we're waiting on that, we can make the crust. It's really easy, just smash up these graham crackers and mix in some melted butter."
    MC "That's it? No like fancy spiced crumble or some kind of special Italian biscotti? Just crackers?"
    PRG "I know it sounds cheap, but believe me, nothing else is as good for getting that classic cheesecake flavor."
    "Well, I wasn't in any position to know better, so I melted a stick of butter on the stove and added it to the pulverized crackers until I got a consistency like wet sand I could mold into a crust."
    PRG "Alright, now coat the bottom and the edges of a springform pan. It's pretty much the only thing those are ever used for."

    PRG "Okay, now we have to cream it."
    MC "What? I thought it was already cream cheese?"
    PRG "Well it is, but it's kind of different. In baking it's referring to incorporating sugar into a fat source like butter, or in this case, cream cheese. Here."
    "Aida handed me a big wooden spoon."
    PRG "You'll see why you want this to be at room temperature. Smash the sugar into it until it's all one consistency."
    "Aida wasn't kidding, the cream cheese was still kind of cool. Trying to smash it all around in a bowl to get the sugar to dissolve into it felt like mixing concrete with a garden trowel."
    "After mixing until my hand nearly froze shut, it looked pretty well mixed."
    PRG "Alright, now we need to add four eggs."
    MC "Four eggs, got it."
    "I proceeded to crack four eggs into a bowl, trying to make sure I didn't get any eggshells in there."
    MCT "No shells, looking good. In ya go!"
    PRG "No wait! You can't add them in all at once. It has to be one at a time."
    MC "Really? Why's that?"
    PRG "It tempers the mixture. Eggs help bind everything together, but if you add too much too soon, they don't end up mixing correctly and it breaks when the protein and fat separate."
    MC "Ah, gotcha."
    "Admittedly I didn't get it, but I was sure glad Aida was watching over me or I would have ruined this thing five times over by now."
    PRG "Only mix just enough to get it incorporated in. Cheesecake is supposed to be dense, we don't want any extra air in it."
    PRG "Now for the special ingredients. In a separate bowl add some flour and sour cream."
    MC "Sour what? Are you serious? I don't want it to taste sour."
    PRG "Don't worry, it won't. It's not much, but the little extra tang in the background is a welcome addition in something as rich as a cheesecake. It helps to make it more palatable."

    PRG "Mix it all in, but not too much, remember? Then it's ready to pour into the pan."
    "The viscous filling oozed over the edge of the bowl as I gently poured it into the prepared pan with the crust. With the added eggs and citrus zest, the bright white color of the cream cheese had taken on a slightly orange/yellow hue to it."
    PRG "Alright that goes in for about one hour. It might take a little less, you're really just looking for it to not be jiggly in the center anymore."
    MC "Great, so it'll be ready in just an hour?"

    MCT "Hmmm, looks like I have everything. Better double check though."
    "I was pleasantly surprised I was able to convince Alice to go along with the idea of cooking together for our next ‘date’, as it were."
    "Honestly it was a pretty good solution to the dilemma I constantly have trying to plan one of our dates: what do you give to the girl that has everything?"
    "My wallet wasn’t big enough to hold all the bills needed to pay for a fancy dinner that would impress her refined pallet, even if such a restaurant existed on this island."
    "That, and just plain dinner at a restaurant was far too mundane after a while, even for such an enthusiastic gourmand as Alice."
    "Not that it wasn’t a solid option every now and then, I knew I just couldn’t over-rely on it."
    "The other part of it was that I wanted to see if I could get Alice to do something outside of her comfort zone. If Alice didn’t want to do something, she wasn’t going to do it."
    "But I figured if anything was going to convince her to go along with something she wasn’t too keen on, the best bet would be something that somehow involved food."
    "After all, it got her to go to the carnival with me. This was an easy sell by comparison. I was genuinely curious to see how she’d do with actually making a recipe herself."
    "Based on our previous conversations, on a scale of ‘Five Star Chef’ to ‘Can make instant ramen’, I don’t think Alice has ever had to use a microwave before."

    WG "Curious... What exactly do you plan on having us make?"
    MC "Well I was thinking of doing something that involved a more hands on approach, for an authentic experience. I asked Aida if she knew of anything like that and she suggested..."
    "I fumbled around for the recipe sheet she had printed out for me."
    MC "Ah, here we go— Pasta Carbonara."
    show WG neutral-2
    WG "That sounds delightful! I don’t think I’ve had that dish since the last time I visited Milan. It feels like it’s been ages, honestly."
    MC "Heh, Aida told me you’d be familiar with it. She walked me through how to make it, saying she needed the practice, so I at least know what’s supposed to happen."
    MC "It should turn out pretty decent if we stick to this recipe."
    MC "Alright, now wash your hands and come join me over here. We’ll start making the pasta."
    show WG neutral
    WG "Sounds good."
    "Checking the recipe, I placed the called‑for amount of flour out on the counter and created a little well for the eggs. I’d never made fresh pasta dough myself, but it didn’t look too difficult, just time consuming."
    "Aida told me a pasta dough used basically one egg per person, so I cracked open six into the flour crater I made, knowing two wasn’t going to be enough for me and Alice."
    "Not that six would either, but I wasn’t sure I had enough eggs for what I needed for the rest of the recipe if I was actually going to attempt to satisfy her appetite— assuming that was even possible."
    show WG worried
    "Alice came over after drying her hands off at the sink. I was admiring my handiwork, having not gotten any eggshells into it. For whatever reason though Alice didn’t seem as enthusiastic."
    WG "What is this?"
    MC "Pasta dough. Erhm, at least the start of it."
    show WG doubt
    WG "It just looks like a mess to be honest."
    MC "It’s a work in progress. Like all good things. We just need to mix it up. Like this."
    "I proceeded to stick a couple fingers into the egg well and shake it back and forth, scrambling them all up into a uniform bright yellow goop."
    MC "Now you just have to get in there with your hands and mash up all that flour into it to make the dough."
    show WG worried
    "Whether it was the goopy texture, the slimy clinging of the runny egg on my fingers, or the seemingly unsanitary nature of handling raw egg, Alice’s expression was one of intense hesitation."
    show WG haughty
    WG "You seem to have this adequately handled, Keisuke. Here, I’ll hold on to this recipe card to prevent it from accidently becoming soiled, and supervise the process so that you don’t accidentally make any missteps."
    MCT "Oh ho ho, mon chéri. You’re not weaseling your way out of this one."
    MC "Oh that should work fine, but you do know the first rule about couples that cook together, right?"
    show WG surprised-2
    WG "What rule? Have I missed something?"
    MC "The person that doesn’t do the cooking has to do the dishes."
    show WG neutral
    WG "On second thought, I can handle the dough. You watched Aida make this so you would be better suited to supervising in this case."
    MCT "That was almost {i}too{/i} easy."
    MC "Oh, almost forgot— don’t forget the salt."
    "I slid a small jar full of rock salt over towards Alice on the counter, before walking to the sink to wash my hands."
    MC "A healthy pinch should do."
    "Alice had no trouble with that step, being well accustomed to optimally seasoning her food as she saw fit. The dough on the other hand was a different story."
    show WG doubt
    WG "Keisuke, you left this as a complete mess, what am I supposed to do with this?"
    MC "It’s fine, just mix it all around and knead it up, until it... well looks like dough."
    WG "Alright, if you say so."
    "Alice fussed around with it, mushing it back and forth for a bit, bringing it into a kind of ugly, shaggy looking state."
    show WG stern
    WG "Keisuke, this looks even worse. Are you sure you didn’t forget to add something?"
    MC "It’s fine, it just needs more flour, you have to keep working and kneading it. It will eventually come together."
    MC "Aida said the trick is not to fuss too much with pushing it, just lean in with your weight and it will take care of itself."
    "I said that, only to start wondering if Alice would crack the counter if she took my instruction too literally."
    "With this easier technique in mind, the dough actually started to come together in a more solid looking state."
    show WG neutral
    "Alice didn’t seem so impatient now that she got to see some results."
    WG "Okay, that looks like a ball of dough. Now what?"
    MC "We have to let it rest. I don’t know why exactly, but it gives us time to do the other stuff."
    WG "It lets the structure loosen up. If you don’t do it, it will come out dense and less flavorful."
    MC "You seem to know a lot about cooking for someone who hasn’t cooked before."
    show WG haughty
    WG "Great chefs are always eager to boast about their technique to a discerning gourmand."
    MC "Well hopefully we’re going to put all that knowledge to good use."
    show WG neutral
    MC "Okay, next we need to make the sauce. It goes in last, but Aida said to make it now because you need to add it at exactly the right time and won’t be able to do it fast enough if you start late."
    MC "Now let’s see... separate six egg yolks."
    WG "I see, we’re going with the authentic version. In America, they often try to pass this dish off as carbonara with a cream sauce, making it as bland as any standard fair alfredo dish."
    MC "Really? That sucks. I’m glad I specifically asked Aida for the most authentic version possible when she offered to make an easier version."

    WG "I can manage just fine."

    show WG neutral
    "I proceeded to crack an egg against the counter with a couple of firm knocks and split the eggshell into two relatively even portions."
    "I then proceeded to sift the yolk back and forth between the shell halves, using the edge of the shell to help slough off the white before dumping the yolk into the other bowl."
    MC "See, this way if everything goes well you don’t get your hands messy."
    WG "Hmm, that seems to be the best way."
    "Alice cracked an egg open successfully only to have done it too hard again, puncturing the yolk while the goopy mix oozed out over the sides of the shell into the discard bowl."
    show WG doubt
    MC "Don’t sweat it. It happens sometimes, even with someone as skilled as Aida. That’s why we have two bowls."
    "Alice proceeded to try again. Not particularly thrilled that she managed to get egg white on her fingers, but this next attempt proved successful in separating the two."
    show WG neutral
    "Having tasted success, and overcoming her initial hesitancy, Alice proceeded to breeze through the last few eggs."
    show WG happy
    WG "There. That is six. That didn’t seem too difficult after all."
    MC "See? Now you got the hang of it. Now, all it needs is pepper and shredded parmesan. Those are really just to taste, so add as much or as little as you want. You’re the chef now."
    show WG haughty
    WG "Well, it simply won’t do to have our dish be under–seasoned now would it?"
    "I couldn’t help but slightly raise my eyebrow at just how much Alice added of both. By the time she was done, it smelled quite pungent of pepper and the liquid itself could barely hold all of the finely shredded cheese."
    "It was quite a bit more than how Aida prepared it, but she did say you could add more than she did. Despite her lack of cooking skills, I didn’t doubt Alice felt confident about how much seasoning her food should have."
    show WG neutral
    MC "Looks good. Alright, now we need to get the meat going in the pan. The recipe is supposed to use this stuff called... guan-chall-ee?"
    WG "Gaunciale."
    MC "Right, that’s it. But good luck finding that on this island. Aida recommended this stuff called pancetta instead, which I managed to find."
    WG "I must say Keisuke, I’m impressed with your effort to provide an authentic experience. You could have just done a lazy cop-out and used bacon, but pancetta is much closer to the spirit of the dish."

    WG "Oh, shut it. Good thing there’s a lot of hair to cover up that big head of yours. What’s next?"
    MC "We gotta dice up the pancetta. I’ll leave it up to you how big you want the pieces, just keep in mind they’re going to shrink. You feel okay about using a kitchen knife right?"
    show WG neutral
    WG "I appreciate the concern, but I’ve had plenty of mishaps and near misses using tailoring shears to know enough to respect a sharp blade."
    MC "Good to know, just make sure you’re letting the knife do the work. Don’t force anything. They keep them in pretty good condition here considering they’re shared by so many people."
    "I was a bit concerned letting Alice chop something up herself since she basically had zero experience with this, but she proceeded to dice up the pancetta in a controlled, deliberate manner."
    "Feeling relieved her previous impatience was not causing her to rush this task, I noted just how large the pieces she cut were. She must have liked a more hearty and rustic texture for this dish."
    "Or maybe she was just being impatient after all and didn’t want to cut so much."
    WG "All done."
    MC "Alright, looks good. Into the pan."
    WG "Okay, but why didn’t you start heating it yet? Wouldn’t that have saved some time?"
    MC "That’s what I would have thought, but Sakura said with fatty cuts the fat melts at a lower temperature than the meat cooks, so you want to start with a cold pan if you’re going to try to render the fat."

    WG "You’re incorrigible, you know that?"

    "Fumbling around though some of the cabinets I managed to find Alice a cooking apron. Most of the cooking club members had their own but I knew they had some spares. I made sure to grab the largest size they had."
    MC "Alright, try this out. We don’t want pork grease splattering on your shirt now."

    "I looped the top opening over Alice’s head and helped drape it down across her protruding middle. Coming around the back to help tie it off I realized I only had a few centimeters of overlap to work with."
    MCT "Shit! Are you kidding me?"
    "Alice really had been getting big recently. I mean she had been since I met her, but I meant BIG, even for this place. The fact that this apron, which resembled a picnic cloth, didn’t adequately wrap her was evidence of that."
    MCT "Time to get creative."
    MC "Hmm, looks like we could get a better fit."
    "Trying not to hesitate so as to not elicit any protest from Alice, I seized the initiative and proceeded to stretch the apron out to gain some extra slack, getting a little handsy in the process."
    show WG surprised-2
    "Reaching around her front, I proceeded to stretch the fabric down across the top of her boobs and tuck it in slightly under, cupping more than a handful in the process."
    WG "Keisuke, what on earth—"
    MC "Just trying to get a good fit so you’ll be comfortable."
    "I proceeded to smooth out the wrinkles in the fabric across the top of her belly, sinking my hand into the doughy mound as I brushed my hand downwards until I simply couldn’t reach further."
    show WG aroused
    WG "Easy there. That spot is a bit sensitive."
    "I proceeded to move my hands outward, smoothing out the fabric out to her sides, slightly digging into her jiggly love handles in the process."
    WG "Mmmph!"
    "Keeping the fabric taut, I pulled the drawstrings together in the back, securing quite a few more centimeters of string to work with to easily tie it off."
    MC "There you go. Perfect fit."
    show WG happy
    WG "Excellent. I appreciate your -ahem- thoroughness in securing a proper fitting."
    show WG neutral
    "Knowing that a grease stain on her shirt might sour her mood about the whole experience, I thought the extra effort was necessary."
    "I knew this was a fair bit out of her comfort zone, so I thought it’d be best to accommodate her as much as possible so it’d still be a positive experience for her."
    "Feeling a bit better that Alice wasn’t going to get grease spots on her shirt, I filled a large pot half full with water and got it on the burner."
    MC "How’s it looking?"
    WG "Seems to be looking good. Nothing is burning, and the fat is starting to render out and onto the pan."
    MC "Yup, looks good. Tell you what, I’ll watch this while you roll out the pasta dough. I think it’s been long enough."
    "I handed Alice a rolling pin."
    MC "Flour up the rolling pin and the counter and just roll it out as thin as you reasonably can. You might want to do it in a few batches since it will spread out so much."
    "I tried not to call too much attention to the fact that six servings of fresh pasta would cover more surface than the entire counter, but she’ll figure it out sooner or later."
    show WG happy
    "Bit by bit the balls of dough she sectioned into three were flattened out into sheets. Alice did seem to be enjoying herself. My guess was it was from the satisfaction of the unfolding transformation process."
    MC "Hey, looking pretty good. Go ahead and cut them into strips."
    "I handed Alice a pizza cutter, figuring that’d be easier than a knife for all that pasta."
    MC "This looks about done, so I’ll add the peas from the freezer."
    show WG neutral
    WG "Frozen peas? I thought you were going for the ‘authentic’ experience?"
    MC "Well, that’s what I thought too at first, but Sakura said some vegetables hold up really well being frozen, especially if you’re going to cook them. She said no restaurant is using fresh peas."
    MC "As skeptical as I was, it sounded a lot better than using canned peas."
    show WG angry
    WG "Ack! Don’t even say that Keisuke— that sounds awful!"
    show WG neutral
    "While Alice worked on slicing the pasta into tagliatelle, I dumped the bag of frozen peas into the pan."
    "I thought the peas were supposed to add a healthy veg to such a rich dish, but Sakura mentioned that peas aren’t as healthy as you’d think, because they have a lot of starch."
    "So this dish had no redeeming health qualities. It was basically one big decadent, creamy, fatty, starch bomb."
    "I couldn’t wait to see Alice’s reaction to the taste. Maybe I should have planned for more servings?"

    show WG neutral
    MC "Well, that didn’t take very long. Let’s kill the heat and drain it in the sink, just save some of the pasta water... for whatever reason."
    WG "It carries starch from the pasta, chefs use it to help with the consistency of the sauce."
    MC "Hmm, interesting. I guess that makes sense. Whoa! Those pasta noodles really swelled up. That looks like over twice as much as we started with."
