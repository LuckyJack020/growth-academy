5. Modding Projects

5.1 Modding projects will need to be installed directly on the official copies of the game. Downloading a main copy of GA from our official sources, and having it installed is our requirement. The Licensor won't tolerate any redistribution of unauthorised standalone copies of the game with modded content, outside of our official releases with a newest build

5.2 Mods need to support the newest build of the game that is available to download from official sources. These include Growth Academy Discord server (discord.gg/gfvG6Sn), DeviantArt profile (https://www.deviantart.com/growthacademy/blog/) or future hosting sites officially supported by the dev team. Even if an existing mod is not up to date, distribution of outdated builds of GA is prohibited.

5.3 Future updates may break mods that are in development. We reserve all rights to change the game, introduce new features and overhaul existing features without any need to explain it or taking a direct responsibility for impacting the development of your mod. Growth Academy is a work in progress game and a lot of things will change before we will reach a final version. We can’t and don’t want to feel obligated about limiting the scope of our game.

5.5 The Licensor won’t tolerate any use of paid and internal assets that were done directly for a game in the standalone projects that aren’t contained within a main game downloaded from sources posted by the Growth Academy dev team

5.6 Standalone fan games can’t use any of paid assets (unless you buy the licence on the store they’re originating from) or internal custom assets that were done directly for a game without our explicit permission. The only thing that is allowed are external assets, which terms of licence allows its use.

5.7 The Licensor won't tolerate profiting financially from mods and Growth Academy itself in any way. The game was always conceived as a non-commercial passion project and we want to keep it that way.

5.8 The Licensor won't tolerate mods using stolen assets injected into our game. Each of the injected assets needs to respect wishes of their original creators based on terms of licence provided by them.

5.9 If we ever work on official modding tools, all mods will need to be retrofitted to be fully compatible with them.

5.10 Each change you have made or will make to characters, fanarts and everything related to your mod needs to be transparent to avoid any confusion with the main game.

5.11 Messaging about the mod needs to be transparent and credit Growth Academy and its developers. Please don’t take advantage of developers' trust for modding projects, undermine their hard work on the project or be insulting towards them because some of the creative choices don't match your personal taste.
